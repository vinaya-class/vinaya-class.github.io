<p>The ten reasons for the establishing of the Pāṭimokkha:</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;For the excellence of the Sangha;</li>
<li>for the wellbeing of the Sangha;</li>
<li>for the control of ill-controlled bhikkhus;</li>
<li>for the comfort of wellbehaved bhikkhus;</li>
<li>for the restraint of the <em>āsavā</em> in this present state;</li>
<li>for protection against the <em>āsavā</em> in a future state;</li>
<li>to give confidence to those of little faith;</li>
<li>to increase the confidence of the faithful;</li>
<li>to establish the True Dhamma;</li>
<li>to support the Vinaya.&quot;</li>

followed.</p>

<!-- latex
\begin{multicols}{2}

<p><strong>Origin:</strong> relates to the ancient belief that soil is alive, and loses
life when dug up.</p>
<p><strong>Object:</strong> 'genuine' soil.</p>
<p><em>Not</em> genuine soil:</p>
<ul>
<li>pure or mostly rock, stones, gravel, sand</li>
<li>burnt or already dug up soil</li>
<li>until rained on for four months</li>
<li>dust from wind erosion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Effort:</strong> Digging, burning, making a hole, or giving command to do it.</p>
<p>Putting tent pegs in the ground is to be confessed.</p>
<!-- latex

-->
<p><strong>Non-offenses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>unknowingly, unthinkingly, unintentionally</li>
<li>indicating a general need or task</li>
<li>digging a trapped person or animal out</li>
</ul>
<p>Allowance to indicate a need or general task to a lay person by &quot;wording
it right.&quot;</p>
<p>The expression <em>kappiya-vohāra</em> (&quot;allowable expression,&quot; or &quot;wording it
right&quot;) is used where an express command would be an offense, but an
indication of a desire or intent would not.</p>

<!-- latex
\begin{multicols}{2}
-->
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> a bhikkhu cuts down a tree where a deva was living. The rule
is formed later, when people complained of the bhikkhus mistreating
one-facultied life.</p>
<p><strong>Object:</strong> Living plant or seed. Lower plant life (i.e. mold, algae,
fungi) is not included.</p>
<p><strong>Effort:</strong> cutting, breaking, cooking, or getting others to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Fruit with seeds:</strong> allowance to make allowable (kappiyam). Fruit can
be kappied in one &quot;heap&quot;.</p>
<!-- latex

<p>To 'kappi' fruit is about the feelings of the donor, not killing the
fruit or transfering kamma.</p>
<p>Knowingly eating un-kappied seeds is dukkata.</p>

<ul>
<li>unknowingly, unthinkingly, unintentionally</li>

<p><em>Vikappana</em> is an arrangement whereby a bhikkhu places robe or cloth
under shared ownership so that it may be stored for any length of time.</p>
<p>If the bhikkhu simply gives the robe back to the stores, he has given up
ownership of it and another bhikkhu would be free to take it.</p>
<p><em>Vikkappana</em> allows a bhikkhu to determine a smaller sanghati while
travelling, but not entirely giving up his regular sanghati.</p>
<p><strong>Object:</strong> robe-cloth, min. 4x8 fingerbreadths, that one has placed
under shared ownership.</p>
<p><strong>Perception</strong> of ownership is not a factor.</p>
<p><strong>Effort:</strong> using the cloth without the ownership being rescinded.</p>

<p>Origin: Ven. Udayin whispers Dhamma sentences in the ears of certain

<p>One should ask a man to chaperon when engaging in a conversation or

<p>The rule is aimed at preventing a bhikkhu from using his knowledge of
Dhamma as a way of making himself attractive to a woman.</p>
<p>Other topics have no penalty, but indulging in 'animal talk' with lay
people may result in censure, banishment or suspension on grounds of
'unbecoming assoication with householders' or 'verbal frivolity.'</p>
<p>Also, observers might misinterpret the situation, best to ask someone to
chaperon.</p>

<p>Same dwelling: one &quot;enclosure&quot;. Technically the same walls and roof, but
one may consider variations (private hospital rooms).</p>
<p>Intention is not a factor, pacittiya even if the bhikkhu doesn't know

<h2><a class="header" href="#pc-1-intentional-lie" id="pc-1-intentional-lie">Pc 1, Intentional lie</a></h2>
<p>Origin: Ven. Hatthaka defeats philosophical opponents by means of lying.</p>
<p><strong>Intention:</strong> to misrepresent the truth</p>
<p><strong>Effort:</strong> to communicate it to sb. based on that aim</p>
<p>Result is not a factor. It doesn't matter if the listener believes it or
not.</p>
<p><em>Telling a conscious lie</em> means: the words, the utterance, the speech,
the talk, the language, the intimation, the (un-ariyan) statements of
the person intent upon deceiving with words.</p>
<p><em>Dukkata</em> for remaining silent when it implies a false message (e.g.
during Patimokka recitation).</p>
<p><em>Dukkata</em> for broken promises, where one is making the promise with pure
intentions but later breaking it.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#non-offenses-4" id="non-offenses-4">Non-offenses</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>unintentionally,</li>
<li>speaking in haste (unconsidered)</li>
<li>slip of the tongue (stupidity or carelessness)</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#jokes" id="jokes">Jokes</a></h3>
<p>Humorous, witty remarks which are true statements are not criticized
even by the Buddha. There are cases of his humour in the suttas.</p>
<p>Irony, sarcasm, satire, boastful- and playful exaggeration are confusing
because one makes physical signs to represent a false statement
(effort).</p>
<p>One may claim not intending to lie, but one's intention is often
ambigous (jolly bantering, wanting to avoid a situation).</p>
<p>Result is not a factor, but others might miss the irony while picking up
the resentment or malice.</p>
<p>The Commentary's examples:</p>
<p>A novice asks a bhikkhu:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you seen my preceptor?</li>
<li>Your preceptor's probably gone, yoked to a firewood cart.</li>
</ul>
<!-- latex
\clearpage
-->
<p>A novice, on hearing the yapping of hyenas:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's making that noise?</li>
<li>That's the noise of those who are lifting the stuck-in-the-mud wheel
of the carriage your mother's going in.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Commentary assigns offence for these and other examples which could
be exaggeration or sarcasm.</p>
<p>Note the Buddha's instruction to Rahula: &quot;Train yourself, 'I will not
utter a deliberate lie, even for a laugh.'&quot;</p>
<p>Intention is fulfilled when the speaker wants the listener to believe a
false statement, even if for a second, even while planning to reveal
that one is only joking.</p>
<p>Practical jokes are <em>pacittiya</em> (e.g. telling sb. that their robes are
lost to see their reaction).</p>
<p>Satire and boastful exaggeration are <em>pacittiya</em>.</p>
<p>Irony, sarcasm, playful exaggeration can sometimes fulfill intention,
sometimes not. Such remarks are often made as a manner of speaking
without the intention to deceive.</p>
<p>Example at Pr 2: a bhikkhu puts away sb's item for safe-keeping. When
the person is looking for it, he ironically responds &quot;I stole it.&quot; The
Buddha says the bhikkhu committed no offence, as it was only a manner of
speaking, not an acknowledgement of theft.</p>

<p>When a bhikkhu receives a new robe, he should mark it for easy

<p>A green, blue, brown or black mark is suitable.</p>
<p>It is suitable to make three small dots in one corner of the robe,
saying, &quot;<em>Imaṁ bindu-kappaṁ karomi</em>,&quot; (I make this properly marked)
while making each dot.</p>
<p>There is no need to make a new mark if it wears off, or if the robe has

is, training him to be skilled in recitation.</p>
<p>The offense includes novices.</p>
<p>The intention of the rule is guard the faith of lay people. If a teacher
makes mistakes, the student may lose respect for them. If the sessions
keep up for a time, the teacher might be seen as hired by the lay
person.</p>
<p>Dhamma here means Pali texts, and only those in the Pali Canon.</p>
<p>The definition doesn't include Mahayana sutras, translations and other
compositions.</p>
<p><strong>Non-offenses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>making someone recite in unison with another bhikkhu (student)</li>
<li>correcting or practicing a passage with a lay person which they are
reading or already memorized (evening chanting)</li>
<li>a bhikkhu learning a passage from a lay person</li>

<!-- latex

<p>Lying down in the same dwelling with an unordained male person for more
than three consecutive nights.</p>
<p>The intention of the rule is to avoid the lay people seeing the bhikkhus
in unsightly attitudes while sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>The same dwelling:</strong> the interpretation is not fixed, as dwellings
come in many forms. Ideas used in various situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>the same roof</li>
<li>having a single common entrance</li>
<li>part of the same enclosure</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes it may be the same building, other times the apartment, other
times the room.</p>
<p><strong>Three consecutive nights:</strong> counted by dawns. If the bhikkhu or the
lay person gets up during the night, the count starts again.</p>
<p>The pacittiya is at lying down at the fourth night.</p>
<p>The lay person may be a different person from one night to the next, but
those nights are still consecutive.</p>

further meetings will only result in greater divisiveness. If both sides
agree, they gather in one place with every bhikkhu in the territory
present (no one should send his consent). A representative of each side
addresses the entire group and makes the blanket confession.</p>
