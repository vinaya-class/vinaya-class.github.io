<p>The ten reasons for the establishing of the Pāṭimokkha:</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;For the excellence of the Sangha;</li>
<li>for the wellbeing of the Sangha;</li>
<li>for the control of ill-controlled bhikkhus;</li>
<li>for the comfort of wellbehaved bhikkhus;</li>
<li>for the restraint of the <em>āsavā</em> in this present state;</li>
<li>for protection against the <em>āsavā</em> in a future state;</li>
<li>to give confidence to those of little faith;</li>
<li>to increase the confidence of the faithful;</li>

'curable'. The person has asked to train, has not given it up, and still commits
the extreme offenses against the training.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Ananda, if it occurs to any of you -- 'The teaching has lost its
authority; we are without a Teacher' -- do not view it in that way. Whatever
Dhamma and Vinaya I have pointed out and formulated for you, that will be your
Teacher when I am gone.&quot; (DN 16)</p>
<p>&quot;The non-doing of all evil, the performance of what is skillful, and the
purification of one's mind: This is the Buddhas' message.&quot; (Dhp 183)</p>
<p>&quot;On one occasion the Blessed One was living in Vesali, in the Great
Wood. Then a certain Vajjian bhikkhu went to him... and said: 'Venerable
sir, this recitation of more than 150 training rules comes every
fortnight. I cannot train in reference to them.'</p>
<p>'Bhikkhu, can you train in reference to the three trainings: the training in
heightened virtue, the training in heightened mind, the training in heightened
discernment?'</p>
<p>&quot;'Yes, venerable sir, I can....'</p>
<p>'Then train in reference to those three trainings.... Your passion,
aversion, and delusion -- when trained in heightened virtue, heightened
mind, and heightened discernment will be abandoned. You -- with the
abandoning of passion... aversion... delusion -- will not do anything
unskilful or engage in any evil.'&quot;</p>
<p>(AN 3.85)</p>
<p>&quot;'Bhikkhus, this recitation of more than 150 training rules comes every
fortnight, in reference to which sons of good families desiring the goal
train themselves. There are these three trainings under which all that
is gathered. Which three? The training in heightened virtue, the
training in heightened mind, the training in heightened discernment....&quot;</p>
<p>(AN 3.88)</p>
<p>&quot;There are these two bright qualities that safeguard the world. Which two?
Conscience &amp; concern for the results of unskillful actions (<em>hiri-ottappa</em>).&quot;</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/iti/iti.2.028-049.than.html#iti-042">Iti 2.15</a>)</p>
<p>“What then is the reason why the spiritual life established by Buddha
Kakusandha, Buddha Konāgamana, and Buddha Kassapa lasted long?”</p>
<p>&quot;[...] they laid down training rules and recited a monastic code. [...] It’s just
like flowers tied with a string to a wooden plank: they are not scattered about,
whirled about, or destroyed by the wind. Why is that? Because they are held
together by a string.&quot;</p>
<p>(<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali">PTS Vin. 3.1–3.40</a>)</p>
<p>If there is some obstacle to [the practice of the training rules], due to time

<p><img src="./includes/mindmaps/pr-3.png" alt="Pr-3" /></p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> bhikkhus develop aversion to the body and kill themselves or
ask an assassin to kill them.</p>
<p>Recommending death or euthanasia can be <strong>parajika</strong> if the instruction is
followed. Hinting fulfils effort, such as &quot;death would be better for you&quot;.</p>
<p>A human being is regarded as such from the time when the 'being to be born' is
established in the womb. This is an uncertain time, sometime after conception
during embryo development. The embryo can't develop otherwise.</p>
<p>There is a distinction between recommending an action something which <em>causes
death in each case</em> (abortion or active contraception) and something which
<em>causes death in some of the cases</em> (a treatment which can go wrong). There is
<strong>no offence</strong> in the second case, e.g. some people are known to die in car
accidents, but it doesn't mean that a bhikkhu can't ask a person to drive.</p>
<p>Turning off life-support equipment: if the ill person stated their position on
it beforehand, the doctors may be simply following his instruction.</p>
<p>Giving permission to the doctor to turn off the equipment is still not parajika
(not cutting off life, it ends on its own), although one might live with a
doubtful heart afterward.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>&quot;No, lord.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If, after descending into the womb, consciousness were to depart, would
name-and-form be produced for this world?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, lord.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If the consciousness of the young boy or girl were to be cut off, would
name-and-form ripen, grow, and reach maturity?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, lord.&quot;</p>

<p>Doesn't include animals smaller than visible to the naked eye. Doesn't

<p>Origin: Ven. Udayin is killing crows by shooting them with arrows, cutting their
heads off and putting them in a row on a stake. The Buddha scolds him, &quot;How can
you, foolish man, intentionally deprive a living thing of life? ...&quot; (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc61/en/horner">Vibh. Pc

<p>Mercy killing by the owner, or euthanasia practices by vets fulfil effort.

<p>Acting in doubt, going ahead anyway is dukkata. Such as when the bhikkhu thinks
that cleaning an item may or may not kill living beings. Trying carefully not to
kill insects while cleaning is not an offence.</p>

<p>&quot;Killing is never skillful. Stealing, lying, and everything else in the first
list are never skillful. When asked if there was anything whose killing he
approved of, the Buddha answered that there was only one thing: anger. In no
recorded instance did he approve of killing any living being at all. When one
of his monks went to an executioner and told the man to kill his victims
compassionately, with one blow, rather than torturing them, the Buddha
expelled the monk from the Sangha on the grounds that even the recommendation
to kill compassionately is still a recommendation to kill—something he would
never condone.&quot;</p>

<p>The moral tensions we encounter in real life should caution us against
interpreting Buddhist ethical prescriptions as unqualified absolutes. And yet
the texts of early Buddhism themselves never recognize circumstances that might
soften the universality of a basic precept or moral value. To resolve the
dissonance between the moral idealism of the texts and the pragmatic demands of
everyday life, I would posit two frameworks for shaping moral decisions. I will
call one the <em>liberative</em> framework, the other the <em>pragmatic karmic</em> framework.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The arguments are also misleading in that they casually dismiss the precept
against killing because it is a moral absolute, as if all absolutes were naïve.
Then they claim that there are circumstances in which the government’s need to
protect its citizenry trumps the precept against killing. In other words, the
need to protect a nation becomes the moral absolute, and yet there is no
explanation as to where it gains its absolute authority, or why it’s more moral
than not killing.</p>
<p>The arguments are further misleading in portraying their stance as “pragmatic,”
implying that the Buddha’s approach is impractical. Actually, the Buddha’s
absolutist approach is the only one that works when passions are aroused. A
conditional or negotiable precept against killing is easily swept aside when
people are overcome by anger or fear. Only a conscience that regards as a moral
absolute the principle of no intentional killing—ever, at all—has a chance in
holding the line against the passions.</p>
<p>Finally, the arguments are misleading in suggesting that their more “pragmatic”
approach is ideal for people who want to approach liberation gradually.
Actually, it’s a recipe for turning one’s back on liberation and marching off in
the opposite direction. Ask any soldier suffering from the long-term effects of
becoming a trained killer, and he or she will tell you that it’s no way to
develop wholesome qualities of mind.</p>

<p><em>(Figure: Overview of the procedure after a Sanghadisesa offence, comparing the
case of immediately informing and concealing.)</em></p>
<p>One doesn't have to wait until one is certain about the offence, speaking to
another bhikkhu about a doubtful situation will at least clear one's conscience
that one is not concealing it.</p>
<p>A bhikkhu who comitted a sanghadisesa must inform another bhikkhu as
soon as possible, but at most until the next dawnrise. The Sangha must
meet and at his request, allow a six-dawn period of penance (<em>mānatta</em>).
If he concealed the offence, a probation period (<em>parivāsa</em>) is required
beforehand.</p>
<p>The Sangha will determine when and where the bhikkhu should observe the
<em>parivāsa</em> and <em>mānatta</em>. These periods are determined by the Sangha and don't
have to occur back-to-back.</p>
<p>After completing <em>mānatta</em> he can only be rehabilitated as a bhikkhu in regular
standing by a community meeting of at least 20 bhikkhus. He is not required to
stay at that particular monastery after having received rehabilitation.</p>
<p>If he commits another sanghadisesa before rehabilitation, he must inform a
bhikkhu and ask a Sangha of at least four to 'send him back to the beginning.'</p>
<p>There is allowance to interrupt and set aside the penance or probation for a
period of time, for example when many visiting monks are expected to arrive at
the monastery for an event.</p>
<p>Characteristic duties during penance:</p>
<ul>
<li>not receiving duties of respect from other bhikkhus</li>
<li>inform visiting bhikkhus that he is undergoing penance</li>
<li>every day, notify every bhikkhu in the monastery of his offence</li>
<li>stay under a separate roof than the other bhikkhus</li>
<li>only leave the monastery when accompanied by four other bhikkhus</li>
</ul>
<p>The duties during probation are the same as during penance, except:</p>
<ul>
<li>inform the Sangha of his offence every fortnight, not every day</li>
<li>only leave the monastery when accompanied by a single other bhikkhu</li>

the touch of this maluva creeper's soft, tender, downy tendril.&quot; (MN 45)</p>

<p>When reconizing that one has been caught up in a sensual fantasy, immediately
visualizing <em>asubha</em> of the body can break up the lustful mental state.</p>
<p>Repeatedly training to notice the signs of <em>asubha</em> changes the unconscious
habits of the dreaming mind as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, if a sensual thought, a thought of ill-will, or a thought of harming
arises in a monk while walking, standing, sitting or lying down, and he
tolerates it, does not abandon it, dispel it, terminate it, and obliterate it,
then that monk is said to be devoid of ardour and wise fear of consequences;
he is constantly and continuously lazy and lacking in energy while walking,
standing, sitting or lying down. (AN 4.11)</p>

<p>Origin: Ven. Udayin whispers Dhamma sentences in the ears of certain
women.</p>
<p>One should ask a man to chaperon when engaging in a conversation or
interview with women.</p>
<p>The rule is aimed at preventing a bhikkhu from using his knowledge of
Dhamma as a way of making himself attractive to a woman.</p>
<p>The rule aims to protect both the woman and the monk. In the origin story, other
women get jealous that Ven. Udayin didn't teach them Dhamma.</p>
<p>Note that male doctors sometime refuse to see female patients without a nurse
present.</p>
<p>Other topics have no penalty, but indulging in 'animal talk' with lay
people may result in censure, banishment or suspension on grounds of
'unbecoming assoication with householders' or 'verbal frivolity.'</p>
<p>Also, observers might misinterpret the situation, best to ask someone to
chaperon.</p>

<h2 id="sg-5-conveying-romantic-messages"><a class="header" href="#sg-5-conveying-romantic-messages">Sg 5, Conveying romantic messages</a></h2>
<p>Origin: Ven. Udayin acts as a matchmaker between several families, some of whom
didn't even know each other before. For some matches they praise him, for other
matches they curse him. In one particular case they treat the girl like a slave,
who repeatedly sends unhappy messages back to her family. (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5/en/brahmali">Vib. Ss. 5</a>)</p>
<p>Only two factors: effort and object.</p>
<p><strong>Effort:</strong> 'Conveying' messages for any romantic purpose from a
momentary date to a wedding. Not business meetings.</p>
<!-- latex
\clearpage
-->
<p>Three stages:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>accepting</em> the request to convey a message</li>
<li><em>inquiring</em> at the second party</li>
<li><em>reporting</em> the response</li>
</ul>
<p>Dukkata for any single stage, thullacaya for any two, sanghadisesa for
all three.</p>
<p>Carrying a letter without knowing the content doesn't fulfill effort.</p>
<p>Keeping email and phone contacts private. Nonetheless it fulfills <em>inquiring</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Object:</strong> A man and a women who are not married to each other, even if
dealing with them via other people.</p>
<p>Reconciling a still married couple is not an offense. Reconciling a
divorced couple is sanghadisesa.</p>
<!-- latex
\enlargethispage{2\baselineskip}
-->
<p><strong>Non-offenses:</strong> messages about non-romantic errands, e.g. community
business, a shrine, a sick person.</p>
<p>'Being married' is clear in the case of a church- or civil marriage, or if there
had been some other formal civic arrangement. Other, more vague, customary forms
of living together, sharing a child, or long-term relationships become difficult

<h2 id="pc-6-lying-down-with-a-woman"><a class="header" href="#pc-6-lying-down-with-a-woman">Pc 6, Lying down with a woman</a></h2>
<p>Origin: Ven. Anuruddha stays at the house of a wealthy woman for a night. She
approaches him, but he remains unmoved, and she leaves. There was no offence,
but the rule is established to avoid similar situations.</p>
<p><strong>Object:</strong> Female human being, even a baby, one's relative or not.</p>
<p><strong>Effort:</strong> in the instant one lies down in the same dwelling when a
woman is lying down.</p>
<p>Same dwelling: one &quot;enclosure&quot;. Technically the same walls and roof, but
one may consider variations (private hospital rooms).</p>
<p>Intention is not a factor, pacittiya even if the bhikkhu doesn't know
about the woman.</p>
<p>Purpose: to avoid situations where people might think that one may have
commited serious offenses. Other people might see the situation and
rumors would be damaging.</p>
<p>Non-offenses for roofed but no walls (pavilion) or walled but not roofed
(corral), but a good idea to avoid nonetheless.</p>
<h2 id="pc-44-private-secluded-place"><a class="header" href="#pc-44-private-secluded-place">Pc 44, Private secluded place</a></h2>
<p>Origin: Ven. Upananda sat down with the wife of a friend on a private and
concealed seat. Later, the husband complained and criticized him. The Buddha
rebuked Ven. Upananda, &quot;Foolish man, how can you sit in private on a concealed
seat with a woman? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it...&quot;
(<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc44/en/brahmali">Vibh. Pc. 44</a>)</p>
<p>The bhikkhu sits with a woman at a secluded place, private to the eye and ear,
without another man present, aiming at privacy. Secluded enough for parajika.</p>

<p>Origin: a woman hears that a monk is going to a village and goes with

<p>Purpose: to avoid people assuming the bhikkhu having an affair with the
woman.</p>
<p>In the monastery, female lay supporters often help with transport which are

<p>Five great gangsters as bad monks:</p>
<ol>
<li>wanting to be honoured, revered and obtain gifts</li>
<li>learning the Buddha's teachings and taking it as his own</li>
<li>accusing a pure practitioner of the holy life of sexual intercourse</li>
<li>taking and using Sangha property to create a following among lay people</li>
<li>&quot;But in this world this is the greatest gangster: he who untruthfully and
groundlessly boasts about a superhuman quality. Why is that? Monks, you’ve
eaten the country’s almsfood by theft.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Object:</strong> superior human states which are not accessible to mundane, ordinary
people (<em>puthujjana</em>). States are categorized in three groups.</p>
<p><em>Mahaggata dhamma</em>, 'expanded states'. Some are are supra-mundane if they depend
on higher jhanas.</p>
<p><em>Lokuttara dhamma</em>, 'transcendent states'. Always supra-mundane. Related to the
eradication of the mental fetters. Nine: Nibbāna plus the four paths and their
four fruitions.</p>
<p><em>Tiracchāna-vijjā</em>, 'animal knowledge'. Always mundane. Examples are occult
abilities, future-telling, giving protective charms, casting malevolent spells,
psychic healing, practicing as a medium, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Perception:</strong> knowing as non-existent, not present in oneself. If it is a
mistaken claim out of overestimation, that would not be parajika.</p>
<p><em>Non-existent</em> defined as &quot;not to be found; not knowing, not seeing a skillful
state within oneself, (yet saying,) 'There is a skillful state within me.'&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Effort:</strong> Addressing a human being. Speaking about the state withing oneself,
or one being in the state.</p>
<p>Explicit:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I have attained the first jhāna&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I have seen the heavenly realms&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I know my previous lifetimes&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Implicit or idiomatic:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I delight in an empty dwelling&quot; (referring to jhana)</li>
<li>&quot;I have no doubts about the Buddha's teaching&quot; (referring to stream entry)</li>
</ul>
<p>Humblebrag:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I am so dumb that before this retreat I didn't understand jhanas.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I am a really slow learner, but I don't have any doubt that the Buddha is right.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;My meditation is nothing much, but you know, sometime you can see really interesting things...&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Virtue signalling:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I have learnt to bow like this from a real Forest Kruba Ajahn.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Those monks talk about football. How could they have even basic samadhi?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Gestures by agreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;The first who leaves their kuti is an arahant.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>False claims made <em>in thought</em> are assigned a <em>dukkata</em> by the Buddha. (Story:
seen by a bhikkhu who could read minds and a devata.)</p>
<p><strong>Intention:</strong> to misrepresent the truth, motivated by an evil desire.</p>
<ul>
<li>knowing that it is a lie, aiming to misrepresent the truth</li>
<li>motivated by an evil desire</li>
</ul>
<p>Evil desire: that others may think of him as such.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> the understanding of the speaker and the listener.</p>
<p>The bhikkhu must understand that he is making a claim. The listener doesn't have
to understand or recognize it.</p>

<p>Origin: Ven. Hatthaka defeats philosophical opponents by means of lying.</p>
<p><strong>Intention:</strong> to misrepresent the truth</p>
<p><strong>Effort:</strong> to communicate it to sb. based on that aim</p>
<p>Result is not a factor. It doesn't matter if the listener believes it or
not.</p>
<p><em>Telling a conscious lie</em> means: the words, the utterance, the speech,
the talk, the language, the intimation, the (un-ariyan) statements of
the person intent upon deceiving with words.</p>
<p><em>Dukkata</em> for remaining silent when it implies a false message (e.g.
during Patimokka recitation).</p>
<p><em>Dukkata</em> for broken promises, where one is making the promise with pure
intentions but later breaking it.</p>
<p><em>White lies:</em> motivation is irrelevant.</p>
<p><em>Remaining silent:</em></p>
<p>During <em>sanghakamma</em> when agreement is signalled by silence, if one remains
silent as a deception: pacittiya.</p>
<p>Silence is a gesture, and fulfils effort as a factor.</p>
<p>Everyday context: sensitive information, or can't be bothered to respond.</p>
<p>Example: &quot;We can discuss it tomorrow&quot; -- (a) just to make him
happy but not intending to meet (b) failing to remember or something comes up
blocking the meeting.</p>
<p>One has to know <em>I am going to lie</em>, and <em>I am lying</em>.</p>
<p>Note: irony doesn't intend to deceive, but satire does. Consider an April Fool's
joke, which fully intends to deceive.</p>
<p>Cruel- or malign jokes: don't let humour comprimise your highest values.</p>
<p>Example: &quot;It's over 9000!&quot; -- intending to impress, but he doesn't know.</p>
<p>Checking one's statements before making them, different levels of confidence in
a statement.</p>

<h3 id="jokes"><a class="header" href="#jokes">Jokes</a></h3>
<p>Humorous, witty remarks which are true statements are not criticized
even by the Buddha. There are cases of his humour in the suttas.</p>
<p>Irony, sarcasm, satire, boastful- and playful exaggeration are confusing
because one makes physical signs to represent a false statement
(effort).</p>
<p>One may claim not intending to lie, but one's intention is often
ambigous (jolly bantering, wanting to avoid a situation).</p>
<p>Result is not a factor, but others might miss the irony while picking up
the resentment or malice.</p>
<p>The Commentary's examples:</p>
<p>A novice asks a bhikkhu:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you seen my preceptor?</li>
<li>Your preceptor's probably gone, yoked to a firewood cart.</li>
</ul>
<p>A novice, on hearing the yapping of hyenas:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's making that noise?</li>
<li>That's the noise of those who are lifting the stuck-in-the-mud wheel
of the carriage your mother's going in.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Commentary assigns offence for these and other examples which could
be exaggeration or sarcasm.</p>
<p>Note the Buddha's instruction to Rahula: &quot;Train yourself, 'I will not
utter a deliberate lie, even for a laugh.'&quot;</p>
<p>Intention is fulfilled when the speaker wants the listener to believe a
false statement, even if for a second, even while planning to reveal
that one is only joking.</p>
<p>Practical jokes are <em>pacittiya</em> (e.g. telling sb. that their robes are
lost to see their reaction).</p>
<p>Satire and boastful exaggeration are <em>pacittiya</em>.</p>
<p>Irony, sarcasm, playful exaggeration can sometimes fulfill intention,
sometimes not. Such remarks are often made as a manner of speaking
without the intention to deceive.</p>
<p>Example at Pr 2: a bhikkhu puts away sb's item for safe-keeping. When
the person is looking for it, he ironically responds &quot;I stole it.&quot; The
Buddha says the bhikkhu committed no offence, as it was only a manner of
speaking, not an acknowledgement of theft.</p>
<h2 id="sg-8-unfounded-parajika-accusation"><a class="header" href="#sg-8-unfounded-parajika-accusation">Sg 8, Unfounded parajika accusation</a></h2>
<p>It matters whether the person is present or not.</p>
<p><strong>Intention:</strong> wanting to remove him from the community. Even when it is 'for
the purity of the Sangha', it is driven by aversion.</p>
<p>Insult, slander, lieing.</p>
<p>Spreading stories. Saying something which may be false, but you believe it to be true.</p>
<p>&quot;Not sure if this is true...&quot; -- engaging in gossip, idle chatter, or false tale
bearing (Pc 1) are not accusations, the person is not present.</p>
<p>Reporting </p>
<h2 id="sg-9-distorting-evidence"><a class="header" href="#sg-9-distorting-evidence">Sg 9, Distorting evidence</a></h2>
<p>Finding a statement which will be misinterpreted, but one can maintain it to be
true.</p>
<p>E.g. quoting out of context is creating a false pretext.</p>
<h2 id="pc-76-unfounded-sanghadisesa-accusation"><a class="header" href="#pc-76-unfounded-sanghadisesa-accusation">Pc 76, Unfounded sanghadisesa accusation</a></h2>
<p>To fulfil <strong>Effort</strong>, The accusation has to be made either in his presence, or getting someone to accuse him in his presence.</p>
<p>Unfounded accusations about his bad conduct or wrong views is a <em>dukkaṭa</em>.</p>
<p>Follow 'face-to-face verdict' (<em>sammukhāvinayo dātabbo</em>) when settling the
matter. The community should hear out both parties, not make decisions about
them without them being present.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an9.11/en/sujato">AN 9.11</a> where a monk accuses
Ven. Sāriputta of hitting him and walking away. The Buddha convenes the
community to hear them out.</p>
<h2 id="np-30-diverting-an-offering-for-oneself"><a class="header" href="#np-30-diverting-an-offering-for-oneself">NP 30, Diverting an offering for oneself</a></h2>
<p>Origin: a donor is preparing to give robes to the community. Bhikkhus from
the group-of-six convince the donors to give the robes to them instead.</p>
<p><strong>Perception</strong> is a factor, one must know that the item is already allocated.
There is no offence if one didn't know.</p>
<p>After forfeiting the item, the bhikkhu will receive it back. The community may
decide if the item is unsuitable for a bhikkhu to use.</p>

<p>In this case, a bhikkhu might hear that somebody wishes to give an item to A,
but he convinces them to give it to B instead. This case can be extended even to
common animals. It is inappropriate behaviour for a bhikkhu, supported by freely
given gifts, to interfere with the freedom of donors in giving freely without
expectations.</p>
<p>There is no offence if the bhikkhu was asked for advice. One may answer, &quot;Give
wherever your gift would be used, or would be well-cared for, or would last
long, or wherever your mind feels inspired.&quot;</p>
<p>No offence if the bhikkhu doesn't know that the item was already allocated.</p>

<!-- latex
\enlargethispage{2\baselineskip}
-->
<p>Origin: the Buddha sees monks carrying heaps of robes tied on their heads, backs
and hips. He sits outside in February when snow was falling to determine how
many robes are reasonable (set of three). The group of six starts to keep
several sets in different monasteries, so the Buddha sets a limit on keeping the
excess, and allows further cloth to be placed under shared ownership.</p>
<p>Encouraging modesty to avoid hoarding requisites.</p>
<p><strong>Object:</strong> a piece of cloth which <em>could</em> be used for making part of a robe, at
least 10 x 20 cm (4 x 8 in). It has to be a suitable material for <em>bhikkhus</em>.
Leather is unsuitable. Black, blue, crimson are not suitable colours for a robe.</p>
<p><strong>Effort:</strong> keeping it for more than ten days without determining it for
use.</p>
<p><em>Making a robe:</em> they can use cloth from the stores to make a robe for the
community, and later request it during a formal meeting such as <em>uposatha</em>.</p>
<p>Or, they may determine the plain cloth before the sewing project and
re-determine the finished item later.</p>
<p><strong>Perception</strong> is not a factor, mis-counting the days is not an excuse.</p>
<p>If the robe develops a hole, it loses its determination. It has to be
mended within 10 days, and determined for use again.</p>
<p>Holes which are small, or located within a hand-span along the edge
don't cause the determination to lapse, but when mended, may require the
robe to be re-determined.</p>
<p><strong>Robe-season:</strong> 4th lunar month of <em>Vassana</em>, from the full moon in
October. During that time one may receive and keep robe-cloth for more
than ten days.</p>
<h2 id="np-2-separated-from-robe"><a class="header" href="#np-2-separated-from-robe">NP 2, Separated from robe</a></h2>
<p>Origin: bhikkhus go travelling on a tour. They leave their sanghatis behind at
the monastery, where the bhikkhus are burdened with having to keep sunning them
to stop them from getting mouldy.</p>
<p><strong>Object:</strong> either one of the bhikkhu's <em>currently determined</em> three
main robes, the <em>antaravāsaka</em> (sabong, lower robe), <em>uttarāsaṅga</em>
(jiwon, upper robe), and <em>saṅghāṭi</em> (outer robe).</p>
<p>This rule doesn't apply to other cloth requisites, such as a work-sabong
or an old jiwon used as a bedsheet.</p>
<p><strong>Effort:</strong> at dawnrise, being outside of 'the same area' than where one's robes
are located.</p>
<p><em>Days and Dawns:</em></p>
<p>The Vinaya definition for <em>one day</em> is the period of time between two
dawnrises.</p>
<p>If one extends a hand and is able to see the lines in the palm (assuming
the sky is clear), the dawnrise <em>has already passed</em>.</p>
<p>One may also use a clock and the time of <em>nautical twilight</em>. While the
Sun is between 12 and 6 degrees below the horizon, dawnrise <em>has not yet
passed</em>. Once the Sun is less than 6 degrees below the horizon, dawnrise
<em>has passed</em>.</p>
<p>'<em>The same area</em>' may be within <em>hatthapasa</em> (arm's reach), in the same
room, building, or the monastery grounds, depending on the local
<em>kor-wat</em>.</p>
<p><em>Eka-kula</em>: 'one family', or one roof, where one person is in charge, with a
clear boundary.</p>
<p><em>Thai kutis</em>: when the bhikkhu is alone, the area is his kuti and hatthapasa
around it. When somebody else is present, hattapasa from his body.</p>
<p>Exception during the robe-season, if one is eligible for extending the <em>kathina</em>
privileges, and unless one has relinquished those privileges. (The 1st month
always applies, one may relinquish the additional 3 months.)</p>
<p><strong>Formal meetings:</strong></p>
<p>By ECM custom, bhikkhus should be present with their three main robes on formal
meetings (e.g. uposatha, kathina, ordination).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, <em>sanghakamma</em> would be still valid without bhikkhus having their
three robes.</p>
<h2 id="np-3-out-of-season-robe-cloth"><a class="header" href="#np-3-out-of-season-robe-cloth">NP 3, Out of season robe cloth</a></h2>
<p>One may receive robes at any time, but keep it undetermined for only 10 days
outside the robe-season.</p>
<p>This rule allows extra robe-cloth to be kept for up to 30 days, when it is not
enough for a robe, and one is expecting to receive more cloth later.</p>
<h2 id="np-6-asking-for-robe-cloth"><a class="header" href="#np-6-asking-for-robe-cloth">NP 6, Asking for robe cloth</a></h2>
<p>Asking a lay supporter who is not a relative, for robe-cloth, except
when one's robes have been stolen or destroyed.</p>
<p>A bhikkhu who arrives at a monastery with no cloth to cover himself may
take any cloth he finds to wear, if he intends to return it when he
obtains a proper robe.</p>
<h2 id="np-7-excess-robe-cloth"><a class="header" href="#np-7-excess-robe-cloth">NP 7, Excess robe cloth</a></h2>
<p>When one's robes have been stolen or destroyed, one may ask for cloth at
most the amount enough for an upper- and lower robe.</p>
<p>There is no offence for accepting cloth when the donors are offering it
for a different reason.</p>
<h2 id="np-8-request-to-improve-robe"><a class="header" href="#np-8-request-to-improve-robe">NP 8, Request to improve robe</a></h2>
<p>An unrelated householder wishes to purchase robes for the bhikkhu, and
he suggests purchasing a more expensive one.</p>
<p>No offence when the lay person is a relative, or has invited one to ask
for cloth.</p>
<h2 id="np-9-request-to-combine-robe-funds"><a class="header" href="#np-9-request-to-combine-robe-funds">NP 9, Request to combine robe funds</a></h2>
<p>As NP 8, but in this case two householders are offering to sponsor
individual pieces of robe, and the bhikkhu suggests them to purchase a
more expensive robe by combining their funds.</p>
<h2 id="np-24-seeking-for-a-rains-bathing-cloth"><a class="header" href="#np-24-seeking-for-a-rains-bathing-cloth">NP 24, Seeking for a rains-bathing cloth</a></h2>
<p>A servant girl goes to the monastery and sees the bhikkhus bathing in
the rain. She returns to Lady Visakha, and tells her that there were no
bhikkhus there, only naked ascetics. She asks the Buddha for permission
to provide rains-bathing cloth for the bhikkhus.</p>
<p>The proper time to seek a rains-bathing cloth is the last month of the
hot season. It may be worn in the last half-month of the hot season and
during the rains season.</p>
<p>One may ask relatives, or supporters who have provided such cloth in the
past.</p>
<h2 id="np-28-keeping-robe-cloth-offered-in-urgency"><a class="header" href="#np-28-keeping-robe-cloth-offered-in-urgency">NP 28, Keeping robe cloth offered in urgency</a></h2>
<p>The robe-season begins with the full moon of Kattika in October, but if
a supporter has urgent reason and can't wait until that time, the
bhikkhus may accept robe-cloth from him 10 days prior, and keep it until
the end of the robe-season.</p>
<h2 id="np-29-separated-from-in-a-dangerous-place"><a class="header" href="#np-29-separated-from-in-a-dangerous-place">NP 29, Separated from in a dangerous place</a></h2>
<p>During the month after the Kattika full moon, a bhikkhu who lives in a
dangerous wilderness, may keep either one of his robes in the village,
for up to six days. The Sangha may authorize a longer period.</p>
<h2 id="pc-58-unmarked-robe"><a class="header" href="#pc-58-unmarked-robe">Pc 58, Unmarked robe</a></h2>
<p>When a bhikkhu receives a new robe, he should mark it for easy
identification, before determining it for use.</p>
<p>A green, blue, brown or black mark is suitable.</p>
<p>It is suitable to make three small dots in one corner of the robe,
saying, &quot;<em>Imaṁ bindu-kappaṁ karomi</em>,&quot; (I make this properly marked)
while making each dot.</p>
<p>There is no need to make a new mark if it wears off, or if the robe has
already been used (and marked) before.</p>
<p>It is suitable to mark any cloth item (angsa, bags, hats) which one
wears on the body.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Luang Pu Mun first asked the visitors how long they have been in the robes, the
monasteries they have practised in and the details of their journey. Did they
have any doubts about the practice? Luang Por Chah replies that he does.</p>
<p>[...] He said he had been studying the Vinaya texts with great enthusiasm but
had become discouraged. The Discipline seemed too detailed to be practical; it
didn’t seem possible to keep every single rule. What should one’s standard be?</p>
<p>Luang Pu Mun listened in silence. Then he gave simple but practical advice. He
advised Luang Por to take the ‘two guardians of the world’ – wise shame (<em>hiri</em>)
and wise fear of consequences (<em>ottappa</em>) – as his basic principles. In the
presence of those two virtues, he said, everything else would follow.</p>

residence without taking leave of an available bhikkhu, except during
the right times.</p>
<p>Right times: the robe season, or when one is making a robe.</p>
<p>The principle of Pc 46 and Pc 85 is to stop bhikkhus spending their time
in inappropriate ways at lay people's homes.</p>
<p><em>Civara-dana samayo</em> and <em>civara-kara samayo</em> are the same time, robe-season.</p>
<p>Keeping people informed about what are you doing.</p>
<p>'Your family' are the people who feel they can refuse your request and tell you
to go away.</p>

<!-- latex
\begin{multicols}{2}

<p>Origin: the group of six monks having entered a village at the wrong time,
having sat down in a hall, talked a variety of worldly talk.</p>
<p>After midday, before dawn, without informing an available bhikkhu,
except for emergencies.</p>
<p>Village, cities, etc., any large inhabited area.</p>
<p>One may take leave in any understood language.</p>
<p>Treating negative response ('No you shouldn't go') with disrespect is Pc 54.</p>
<p>&quot;Vikāle gāmappa-vesanaṃ āpucchāmi.&quot;<br />
&quot;Vou à cidade na hora errada.&quot;<br />
&quot;A városba megyek a rossz időben.&quot;<br />
&quot;Je vais au ville pendant la mauvai periode.&quot;<br />
&quot;I am going into the village at the wrong time.&quot;</p>
<p>The rule applies during the whole year.</p>
<p>During the Vassa, the additional concern is that one must return before the next
dawn, or make a determination before leaving, that one intends to return within
7 days.</p>
<p>If a community of 5 bhikkhus wanted to observe Kathina, but if one of them
breaks the Vassa, they can't.</p>
<p>Example: During the Vassa, a bhikkhu goes to town for some purpose and doesn't
determine to return within 7 days. If his transport breaks down and he can't
return, or if he has an accident and wakes up in the hospital next morning, his
determination of the Vassa is broken.</p>

drink, streets, wells, those departed before, diversity, speculation about the

<p>Lighting a fire, or getting it lit, when one is not ill for warming
oneself, unless there is a suitable reason.</p>
<p>Allowance for wording it right.</p>
<p>Perception of one being ill or not is not a factor.</p>
<p>One should be sure that the extra warmth is necessary for one's health
before lighting a fire.</p>
<p>Lighting a fire in the sauna is not an offence.</p>
<p>There is no offence for lighting a for a purpose other than warming oneself,
such as boiling water or burning dead leaves or firing a bowl.</p>
<p>On living soil there can be Pc 10, on living plants there can be Pc 11. Using a

<p>Origin: King Bimbisara waited for the bhikkhus to finish bathing at the

the king finished, the city gates were already locked.</p>
<p>The original formulation was later relaxed.</p>
<p>Taking a long shower while others are waiting, or showering like a lobster:

<h2 id="pc-84-picking-up-a-valuable"><a class="header" href="#pc-84-picking-up-a-valuable">Pc 84, Picking up a valuable</a></h2>
<p>Origin: a bhikkhu picks up a brahmin's money-bag who forgot it at the
river bank. When he gives it back, the brahmin claims it had more money
in it.</p>
<p>The purpose is to avoid getting mixed up in cases of ownership and value
of property.</p>
<p><em>Valuable</em> or <em>what is considered a valuable</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Outside</strong> a monastery, one should leave the valuables where they are.</p>
<p>One may wait at the item until the owner appears.</p>
<p><strong>Inside</strong> a monastery, one should pick them up and put them away for
safe keeping. This includes money.</p>
<p>One should take note of the features of the item, and confirm the true
owner carefully.</p>
<p>Finding keys or valueables outside: maybe take it out of cover and put it in a
place where it can be found when the owner comes looking.</p>
<p>Leaving cars or valueables in the monastery when travelling: get the permission
to use from the owner in writing. Get the owner to sign a paper to give away
after six months.</p>

<p>Eating staple or non-staple food, from mid-day until dawnrise.</p>
<p>Mid-day, or noon, is when the Sun is at zenith. This may be a few minutes ahead
or behind of 12:00. It may be around 13:00 during daylight-savings time.</p>
<p>Categories of edibles: (1) Staple, (2) non-staple, (3) juice drinks, (4) the
five tonics, (5) life-time medicines and (6) water.</p>
<p>Staple, non-staple, medicine etc. van vary according to the context of different rules.</p>
<p>Staple food (<em>bhojaniya</em>): cooked grains, bread, pasta, vegetables, fish, meat, etc.</p>
<p>Non-staple food (<em>khādaniya</em>): side dishes, roots, tubers, fruits, nuts, seeds,
juice drinks, tonics, medicines, cakes, drinking conjey, etc.</p>
<p>Medicines: 'any edible that is used as a medicine but does not fit under
categories of staple or non-staple food, juice drinks or the five tonics' (BMC
definition).</p>
<p>Tonics: ghee, fresh butter (or cheese), oil, honey, sugar.</p>
<p>Unallowable meats: human, elephant, horse, dog, lion, tiger, leopard, bear,
hyena, snake. <em>Thullcaya</em> for human, <em>dukkata</em> for others.</p>
<p>Eggs, blood, etc. are included under 'meat'. Consuming uncooked (raw) meat is <em>dukkata</em>.</p>
<p>'Eating' is defined as 'entering the mouth'.</p>
<p>Swallowing food disloged from between the teeth, or chewing and swallowing
unchewed food passed up from the stomach is not an offence.</p>
<p>Cooking is not allowed, but heating up is not an offence.</p>
<p>Being ill is not an exception, since the 7 day tonics are allowed for that
reason.</p>
<h2 id="pc-38-stored-food"><a class="header" href="#pc-38-stored-food">Pc 38, Stored food</a></h2>
<p>Origin: The Ven. Belatthasisa keeps the leftover rice from his alms-round and
moistens it the following day, to stay in solitude. Even though the motivation
(frugality) is innocent, the Buddha still rebukes him and recommends going
alms-round every day instead.</p>
<p>The convenince of stored food can lead to lack of effort to train and being
disconnected from reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In the course of the future there will be bhikkhus who will live entangled
with monastery attendants and novices. As they are entangled with monastery
attendants and novices, they can be expected to live intent on many kinds of
stored-up consumables and on making blatant signs (identifying their) land and
crops.&quot; (AN 5.80)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>'Stored-up' means formally received by any bhikkhu, and keeping it beyond the
next dawn.</p>
<p>Relinquishing it to a novice or lay people, who may store and offer it later is
allowed. If the bhikkhu hasn't relinquished it, it is not allowable (dukkata).</p>
<p><strong>Perception</strong> about the food having been stored-up is not a factor.</p>
<h3 id="non-offences-3"><a class="header" href="#non-offences-3">Non-offences</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>the act of storing it is not an offence, a bhikkhu may carry a lay person's
food while travelling</li>
<li>no offence for telling an unordained person to store it</li>
<li>a designated food-store is allowed</li>
<li>no offence for setting food aside and consuming it within the right period</li>

<p>Finer staple foods: ghee, fresh butter (or cheese), oil, honey, sugar, fish, meat,
milk, curds.</p>
<p>Object, effort, result.</p>
<p>Sk 37 covers non-fine staples: &quot;Not being ill, I will not eat rice or
bean curry that I have requested for my own sake: a training to be
observed.&quot;</p>
<p>Hence, dukkata for requesting and consuming other staple foods, except
when one is ill.</p>

<h2 id="pc-40-unoffered-food"><a class="header" href="#pc-40-unoffered-food">Pc 40, Unoffered food</a></h2>
<p>Origin: a bhikkhu eat food which was left as dedication to the ancestors in a
cemetery. People complained and criticized. &quot;That bhikkhu is strong, perhaps he
feeds on human flesh.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Object:</strong> whatever is fit to eat.</p>
<p>One may drink water, or use tooth-cleaning sticks without it being offered.</p>
<p><strong>The act of offering</strong> is described in the Vibhanga.</p>
<ul>
<li>Standing within hand's reach (<em>hatthapasa</em>),</li>
<li>receiving with the hand,</li>
<li>with something in contact with the body,</li>
<li>or the item being dropped and caught.</li>
</ul>
<p>The food item becomes 'not offered' when the bhikkhu relinquishes ownership or
control. 'Unoffered' after touching or being moved is a practice for clear
boundaries for the bhikkhus and lay people.</p>
<p><strong>Effort:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>dukkata for taking the unoffered item</li>
<li>pacittiya for every mouthful</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Perception</strong> of the item being offered or not is not a factor.</p>

rescinded.</p>

<h2 id="pc-51-intoxicants"><a class="header" href="#pc-51-intoxicants">Pc 51, Intoxicants</a></h2>
<p>Origin: Ven. Sāgata awes the lay supporters in Kosambi with his psychic power by
doing battle with a fire-nāga. The supporters ask the bhikkhus what they could
offer or prepare for them. The group of six ask them to prepare liquor. When the
supporters see Ven. Sāgata on alms-round, they offer him liquor house after
house, and he passes out at the city gate. The Buddha and other bhikkhus see
him, and carry him back to the monastery. There, he forgets being deferential to
the Buddha and sleeps in a helpless stupor.</p>
<p><strong>Object:</strong> any alcoholic beverage.</p>
<p>Alcohol is criticized because it destroys one's sense of shame, weakens one's
discernment and can put one into a stupor. Hence this rule is extended to other
intoxicants such as narcotics and hallucinogens by the Great Standards.</p>
<p><strong>Perception</strong> about whether a liquid counts as alcoholic is not a mitigating
factor. For example drinking champagne when thinking it to be carbonated apple
juice.</p>
<p><strong>Effort:</strong> taking any amount, even as little as the tip of a blade of grass.</p>
<h3 id="non-offences-4"><a class="header" href="#non-offences-4">Non-offences</a></h3>

<p>After accepting the provisions, the bhikkhu should inform the other to not accept more at that place.
It is a <em>dukkaṭa</em> offence to not do so.</p>
<p>The term 'provisions' here refers to food prepared for <em>someone else</em> going on a journey.
Hence there is no offence if the food was prepared <em>for the bhikkhu</em>, although restraint should be exercised.</p>

<p>Origin: some bhikkhus selectively accept some alms-food from one donor, then go
to another donor to have something else they like. The first donor could have offered
all the food they needed, and feels hurt that they went somewhere else for more.</p>
<p>If the bhikkhu already accepted all that the donor wanted to give,
it is not an offence to seek more alms if he would need more food.</p>
<p>The donor may offer more food, and the bhikkhu may accept or refuse certain
items, until he has finished eating (removes his hands from the bowl and pushes
it away, getting up from his seat).</p>
<p>If he refused an item from one donor, he may not accept another item from
another donor.</p>
<p>If he has finished eating, and he had refused more food earlier,
he can't accept more food items which are not leftovers.</p>
<p>If he has finished eating, but he <strong>had not</strong> refused more food earlier,
he may accept more food items.</p>
<p>If another donor arrives with more food, and the bhikkhu had refused some food
earlier, he should ask permission from the earlier donor before receiving more
food, to avoid offending them.</p>

<h2 id="np-10-fund-with-steward"><a class="header" href="#np-10-fund-with-steward">NP 10, Fund with steward</a></h2>
<p>&quot;For anyone for whom gold and silver are allowable, the five strings
of sensuality are also allowable. [...] That you can unequivocally
recognize as not the quality of a contemplative, not the quality of
one of the Sakyan sons.&quot; (<a href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN42_10.html">SN 42.10</a>)</p>
<p>The purpose of the rule is to free bhikkhus from the complex responsibilities of
buying and selling, while facilitating the means and protocols for their support
with money.</p>
<p>Origin: Mendaka offers funds for the Sangha.</p>
<p>A bhikkhu is not allowed to accept other funds either, such as jewels,
commodities, land, livestock, etc.</p>
<p>A bhikkhu may designate a lay steward to manage funds offered for the bhikkhu's
support.</p>
<p>If the bhikkhu harasses the steward with impatient prompting, even if he obtains
the requisite, the item must be forfeited and the NP offence confessed.</p>
<p>If the bhikkhu exceeds the number of allowed promptings, he incurs the NP
offence when obtaining the item.</p>
<p>A verbal prompting may be substituted with two silent ones: from 6 verbal and 0
silent, to 0 verbal and 12 silent.</p>
<p>If the steward fails to use the funds to support the bhikkhu, he should inform the donors.</p>
<p>When speaking with the steward, the bhikkhu should indicate what he needs, but
may not use commands to tell them, 'Give me an X, get an X for me with the fund'.</p>
<p>Funds for the Sangha or a group follow the same protocols.</p>
<p>Funds set up for one kind of <em>lahubhaṇḍa</em> may be used for another kind, with a
decision via <em>apalokana-kamma</em>.</p>
<p>Funds set up for <em>garubhaṇḍa</em> (lodgings, furniture, etc.) may not be diverted for
<em>lahubhaṇḍa</em>, but NP 20 allows the community to arrange <em>garubhaṇḍa</em> to be sold
and purchase <em>lahubhaṇḍa</em>.</p>
<p>Examples: paying for electricity from the 'cat's fund' (<em>lahubh.</em> to <em>lahubh.</em>),
selling land to buy another (<em>garubh.</em> to <em>garubh.</em>).</p>
<p>Restricted funds may only be used for the designated purpose (Trust law).
Example: donation form selection options.</p>
<p>In the case of invitations, follow the four-month period protocol in Pc 47.</p>
<p>There is no exemption for relatives or people who have invited the bhikkhu to ask.</p>
<p><strong>Object:</strong> A fund left with a steward to buy robe cloth, or any fund for any
type of requisite (including construction or book printing).</p>
<p><strong>Steward:</strong> a layperson or entity responsible for handling funds or
transactions on behalf of a bhikkhu or group of bhikkhus.</p>
<p>Three types of stewards:</p>
<!-- latex

<p>Allowable: </p>

person is the steward&quot;.</p>
<p>Unallowable: </p>
<ul>
<li>Accepting money (see NP 18). You should tell the donor that bhikkhus don't
accept money.</li>
<li>If a donor asks you who your steward is and you say, &quot;Give it to him&quot; or &quot;He
will keep it&quot; (see NP 18).</li>
<li>If a donor asks you who your steward is and you say, &quot;He will buy it&quot; or &quot;He

a question to which you may give an allowable answer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="np-18-gold-silver-and-money"><a class="header" href="#np-18-gold-silver-and-money">NP 18, Gold, silver and money</a></h2>
<p>A bhikkhu is forbidden to accept gifts of money, getting others to accept them,
or consent to it being placed next to him.</p>
<p><em>Perception</em> is not a mitigating factor.</p>
<p><em>Intention</em> is not a mitigating factor. The bhikkhu may not accept the money for
someone else's sake.</p>
<p>NP offence: the money is forfeit, can not be used for the benefit of bhikkhus.</p>
<p><em>Discussion:</em> unaware of receiving money (wrapped in a bolt of cloth, hidden
with food offerings).</p>
<p>When informing lay supporters who wish to make a donation, the proper language
should be used, i.e. not giving them instruction what to do with their money.</p>
<p>If the donor does not intend the money for the bhikkhu (i.e. offering it to
support the monastery in general), it is not an offence to allow them to place
the money next to the bhikkhu.</p>
<p>If someone drops money into a bhikkhu's bowl against his protest, he may ask
someone to remove it without an offence. The offence is incurred when he start
walking away with it.</p>
<p>The term 'gold or silver' includes the materials, and whatever is used as currency.</p>
<p>A currency is:</p>
<ul>
<li>used for the purpose of general exchange</li>
<li>have a standardized value</li>
<li>presentable by any bearer</li>
</ul>
<p>Not a currency:</p>
<ul>
<li>a money order or check made out to a specific person</li>
<li>credit- and debit cards</li>
<li>a store's voucher, gift card, or discount points</li>
<li>food stamps</li>
<li>promissory notes</li>
</ul>
<p>Credit cards are not a currency, but are not allowable to use (see NP 20).</p>
<p><em>Inheritance:</em> The executor holds the money before distributing it to the
beneficiaries. The bhikkhu may advise the executor to put the money into a
certain Trust.</p>
<p>A bhikkhu may own property, land, houses, etc. but not the money to manage it.</p>
<p>A Trust may be setup to hold only property, but not money.</p>
<p><em>Store credit:</em> a lay person may leave money at a store, and arrange that they
serve a bhikkhu using that credit when he asks (Amazon voucher, restaurant,
pastry shop).</p>
<h3 id="non-offences-9"><a class="header" href="#non-offences-9">Non-offences</a></h3>
<p>There is no offence for a bhikkhu, in the monastery, to pick up gold or money
and put it away for safe keeping.</p>
<h2 id="np-19-selling-or-buying"><a class="header" href="#np-19-selling-or-buying">NP 19, Selling or buying</a></h2>
<p>This covers the case when a bhikkhu would instruct someone else to arrange the
trade, without himself accepting the money.</p>
<p>There is no allowance for 'wording things right' (<em>kappiya-vohāra</em>).</p>
<p>A bhikkhu may advise a steward to sell some items and purchase others, but <strong>may
not</strong> instruct them to sell something or invest money for profit.

<h2 id="sg-10-schismatic-group"><a class="header" href="#sg-10-schismatic-group">Sg 10, Schismatic group</a></h2>
<p>A schismatic group forms when bhikkhus, who would previously observe the
<em>Pāṭimokkha</em> recitation and conduct community meetings together when living in
the same territory, conduct them separately.</p>
<p><em>Origin:</em> The Kosambī dispute (<em>Mv.X</em>) and Devadatta's schism (<em>Cv.VII</em>).</p>
<p>When a bhikkhu is agitating for a schism, it is the duty of the other bhikkhus
to reprimand him. If they don't, they incur a <em>dukkaṭa</em>. If he is not
reprimanded, he is free to continue without incurring a penalty.</p>
<p>The protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li>reprimand him 3 times, informally</li>
<li>admonish him 3 times at a formal community meeting</li>
<li>recite a rebuke with one motion and three announcements</li>
</ul>
<p>He only incurs the <em>saṅghādisesa</em> after the last announcement.</p>
<p>The same protocol of reprimand, admonishment and rebuke applies to <em>Sg 11, 12, 13</em>.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> discuss the procedure and valid reasons for declaring a bhikkhu <em>persona
non grata</em> (a person who is not welcome). One might call the police and refer to
laws of breaching one's peace, invading property or trespassing.</p>

<p>Dealing with a bhikkhu who is a 'corrupter of families', causing them to stop
supporting bhikkhus of good conduct.</p>
<p><em>Origin:</em> Members of the group-of-six train their lay supporters in a corrupt
culture. As a result they favoured socializing, easy-going, frivolous and chatty
monks, and withdrew support from bhikkhus behaving with restraint.</p>
<h2 id="pc-9-telling-an-unordained-person-about-serious-offence"><a class="header" href="#pc-9-telling-an-unordained-person-about-serious-offence">Pc 9, Telling an unordained person about serious offence</a></h2>
<p>Serious offence: <em>pārājika</em> or <em>saṅghādisesa</em>.</p>
<p>Reporting on other offences are a <em>dukkaṭa</em> offence.</p>
<p>The purpose of the rule is to protect both ordained and unordained people.</p>
<p>An unordained person's offences are a <em>dukkaṭa</em> offence to report on, such as
breaking the Five Precepts.</p>
<p>The community may authorize informing the lay people, if that might to improve a
difficult situation, by unanimous agreement through <em>apalokana-kamma</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Perception</strong> is not a mitigating factor.</p>
<p><strong>Effort:</strong> The statement has to include both the action and the class of
offence: 'He had his meal past midday, which is a <em>pācittiya</em> offence'.</p>
<p>Discrediting a fellow bhikkhu is grounds for Pc 13. When lay people ask why is a
community member standing at the end of the line, it is better to say 'he is
undergoing a procedure defined in the monastic code'.</p>
<h2 id="pc-12-evasive-reply"><a class="header" href="#pc-12-evasive-reply">Pc 12, Evasive reply</a></h2>
<p>A bhikkhu wants to hide his offences when being formally questioned, by
responding evasively. He might try changing the topic, keep asking questions, or
making unrelated statements.</p>
<p><em>Perception</em> is not a mitigating factor. ('I just said what I thought, I didn't want to confuse anyone.')</p>
<p>An evasive reply or remaining silent when questioned is a <em>dukkaṭa</em>. The
community then may make a formal charge of evasive speech. If he continues, the
offence is <em>pācittiya</em>.</p>
<p>It is not an offence to remain silent when:</p>
<ul>
<li>not understanding what is being said</li>
<li>too ill to speak</li>
<li>feeling that speaking will create conflict or turn people against each other</li>
<li>feeling that the community is not going to act fairly or according to the rule</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pc-13-criticising-community-official"><a class="header" href="#pc-13-criticising-community-official">Pc 13, Criticising community official</a></h2>
<p>The Buddha gave allowance for the bhikkhu community to organize their duties by
appointing officials in roles such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>distributing food</li>
<li>assigning lodgings</li>
<li>keeping meal invitation rosters</li>
<li>kitchen liaison</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The official should conduct his duties without bias.</p>
<p><strong>Perception</strong> is not a factor, e.g. as to the whether he was authorized
properly or not, whether he is biased or not.</p>
<!-- latex
\clearpage
-->
<p>If one criticises a community official as being unfair, but it turns out that he
was fair (following established procedure), and it was the <em>complainer</em> who was
acting out of disappointment (didn't get what he wanted), the offence is
incurred.</p>
<p>One's <strong>Intention</strong> is to make him lose face, status, or feel embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>Effort</strong> is criticizing or complaining to another bhikkhu with this intention.</p>
<p>Insulting him face-to-face is <em>Pc 2</em>, whether he is biased or not.</p>
<h3 id="non-offences-11"><a class="header" href="#non-offences-11">Non-offences</a></h3>
<p>It is not an offence to voice criticism when the official is habitually acting
out of bias -- desire, aversion, delusion or fear.</p>

regular confusion when communicating with lay supporters who bring food offerings.</p>

<p>The following responses in an argument are logical fallacies, which distract and redirect the discussion from the original topic.</p>
<p>A useful corrective measure is to re-state the issue at hand, supported by direct observations.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Attack</strong>, <em>ad hominem</em></p>
<p>'You are only one Vassa and you think you know better? Who do you think you are?'</p>
<p>Attacking the person bringing up an issue, avoiding the issue being discussed. A type of Red Herring argument.</p>
<p><strong>Appeal to Hypocrisy</strong>, <em>tu quoque</em>, 'whataboutism'</p>
<p>'What about when you did X? Given that, your opinion can't be worth much.'</p>
<p>Avoiding the issue by directing attention to the faults of the accuser.</p>
<p><strong>Two Wrongs Make a Right</strong></p>
<p>'That man has already injured these animals, the damage is done, so we should kill them quickly.'</p>
<p>Pointing to another's guilt to justify one's wrong action.</p>
<p><strong>Redefinition</strong></p>
<p>'But if we define it as X, it is not wrong any more.'</p>
<p>Avoiding the issue by debating the definition of terms instead.</p>
<p><strong>Not Invented Here</strong></p>
<!-- latex
\enlargethispage*{2\baselineskip}
-->
<p>'I have done it several times like this. It's better than following messed up ideas from the X sect.'</p>
<p>Preferring the idea which originates from oneself, or from one's own group, instead of discussing the action and its merits.</p>
<p>The opposite bias is 'Appeal to Authority', where preference is placed apart from oneself, such as an influential authority, or their group.</p>
<!-- latex
\clearpage
-->
<p><strong>Appeal to Authority</strong></p>
<p>'Jesus emphasised love and compassion, not finicky rules.'</p>
<p>Avoiding discussing one's directly observed actions by defending oneself with a source of authority (which may be irrelevant).</p>
<p><strong>Appeal to Nature</strong>, loaded language</p>
<p>'It is an unnatural product, so good monks shouldn't use it.'</p>
<p>Supporting a conclusion using loaded terms which are ambiguous in their values. (Poisons are also natural, while footwear is unnatural.)</p>
<p><strong>Cherry Picking</strong>, one-sided assessment</p>
<p>'An Xbox is not specifically in the Vinaya but it's a huge discount so it's okay to get one.'</p>
<p>Ignoring or downplaying evidence which undermines one's opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Texas Sharpshooter</strong>, jumping to conclusions</p>
<p>'Eating breakfast before the meal is not proper practice. I know many people who
disrobed, and several of them used to eat breakfast.'</p>
<p>Grasping at particular cases which support the conclusion one wants, even though the results could be due to chance.</p>
<p><strong>Slippery Slope</strong></p>
<p>'Today it's just coffee, but you know how drug addictions start!'</p>
<p>Exaggarating the results of trivial causes.</p>

<h2 id="sg-6-too-large-hut-without-sponsor-or-approval"><a class="header" href="#sg-6-too-large-hut-without-sponsor-or-approval">Sg 6, Too large hut without sponsor or approval</a></h2>
<p><em>Origin:</em> Some bhikkhus, not having a sponsor, keep harassing the lay people
with requests about building materials for their own huts, and the people begin
to avoid them.</p>
<p>Dwellings are <em>garubhaṇḍa</em> articles. They may belong to either the community or
to an individual bhikkhu. When given to the community, the ownership of the
dwelling may <em>not</em> be transferred to a bhikkhu.</p>
<p>For a community, whose members may change over time, it is better when the
dwelling belongs to the community, even if an individual bhikkhu has built it
himself. The dwellings can be assigned as needed, and the community can oversee the
proper handling of building projects.</p>
<p><strong>A hut:</strong> Here, a more permanent structure (such as one with plastered walls
and roof). This rule doesn't apply to makeshift huts with grass roofs.</p>
<p>Assuming the <em>sugata span</em> to be 25cm, the maximum size of the hut is about 3m x 1.75m.</p>
<p>If a bhikkhu is planning to build such a hut by procuring the materials for it,
he must (1) choose a site and arrange it to be cleared (not breaking <em>Pc 10</em> and
<em>Pc 11</em>), (2) ask the community to inspect and approve the site.</p>
<p>The site must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>free of disturbances (termites, rats, elephants, bears, etc.)</li>
<li>not near busy locations (crop fields, theme parks, horse stables, etc.)</li>
<li>enough free land around the hut for a man carrying a ladder to walk around it</li>
</ul>
<p>The trees don't have to be cut down, but this prevents the hut to be build right
against someone else's property.</p>
<p>A bhikkhu may ask for people to give him help, either through labor or
materials, but careful arrangements should be made. The people should be
reimbursed if they didn't donate the effort or materials.</p>
<p>The bhikkhu may not ask for expensive materials directly, but may indicate what
his project is, and if people offer the materials, he may accept it.</p>
<p>It is not an offence to build a hut for another's use.</p>

<h2 id="pc-14-leaving-bed-or-bench"><a class="header" href="#pc-14-leaving-bed-or-bench">Pc 14, Leaving bed or bench</a></h2>
<p>When a bhikkhu takes community furniture or tools out to the open (either for
doing work or for cleaning), he should put them away before departing for another
business, or have someone put them away to a covered place where they will not
be damaged by rain, or animals. Dogs might carry them off or birds might leave
droppings on them.</p>
<p>The purpose of the rule is to train the bhikkhus' sense of responsibility for
community items.</p>
<p><em>Departing</em> is defined as going farther than ~18 meters from them.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="pc-15-spread-bedding"><a class="header" href="#pc-15-spread-bedding">Pc 15, Spread bedding</a></h2>
<p>When a bhikkhu has taken bedding items from the stores for use, such as when
settling in a room after arriving, he is responsible for cleaning and putting
them back before departing.</p>
<p>The purpose of the rule is to prevent bedding left in an empty hut, where mould,
ants, etc. might damage them.</p>
<p>One should tidy up one's room or hut before leaving a monastery, in a way that
it is ready for another bhikkhu to use.</p>
<p>There is no offence if someone else (such as the guest monk) has already set out
the bedding without one having asked for them. In that case, the guest monks is
responsible for putting the items back.</p>
<h2 id="pc-16-intruding-on-bhikkhus-sleeping-place"><a class="header" href="#pc-16-intruding-on-bhikkhus-sleeping-place">Pc 16, Intruding on bhikkhu's sleeping place</a></h2>
<p>A bhikkhu shouldn't knowingly intrude on another bhikkhu's dwelling space, with
the intention to forcing him out.</p>
<p><em>To intrude</em> is defined as lying or sitting down within 75cm of his sleeping
place, or on the way to the entrance.</p>
<p>There is no offence in intruding for a compelling reason, such as suffering from
the cold or heat, being sick, or begin in danger. One should leave after the
reason to intrude has passed.</p>

<p><em>Origin:</em> some group-of-six bhikkhus were fixing up a dwelling where they wanted
to spend the Vassa. Some group-of-seventeen bhikkhus waited for them to fix it
up, then drove them out, forcibly taking over the dwelling.</p>
<p>The offence relates to acting out of anger as a primary impulse. Frustrated
greed also produces anger (not getting the hut one wished for).</p>
<p>There is no offence if one's primary motivation is not anger. For example, the
guest monk might have to evict a bhikkhu who is holding onto a dwelling after
being told to leave. There may be anger, but it is not the primary impulse.</p>
<p>A bhikkhu may evict one's student if he is not properly observing his duties.</p>

<p><em>Origin:</em> Ven. Channa is unsatisfied with the plastering being done on the roof
and walls of his hut. He keeps instructing the builders to put on more layers,
until the hut caves in.</p>
<p>The purpose of the rule is to prevent abusing the generosity of the sponsors and
ruining a building project with insatiable requirements. It relates to <em>Sg 7</em>,
when one's hut is sponsored, and one should oversee that the work is done
properly.</p>
<h2 id="pc-87-tall-bed-or-bench"><a class="header" href="#pc-87-tall-bed-or-bench">Pc 87, Tall bed or bench</a></h2>
<p>When making a new bed or bench or having it made, its legs should be at most
eight finger-breadths long, from the lower edge of the frame to the floor.
The long legs should be cut back to size.</p>
<p>The purpose is to prevent making imposing furnishings.</p>
<h2 id="pc-88-cotton-stuffing"><a class="header" href="#pc-88-cotton-stuffing">Pc 88, Cotton stuffing</a></h2>
<p>If a bhikkhu orders a bed or bench upholstered with cotton down, the upholstery
should be torn off.</p>
<p>Cotton down used to be a luxury material. It is allowed for certain items, such
as pillows, which should be no larger than the size of the head.</p>
<p>The purpose is to avoid ostentatious, grand and luxurious materials for
furnishings which are not in line with the restrained life style of a mendicant
monastic.</p>

<p>Allowed materials for a <em>needle box</em> are not explicit, but a <em>needle tube</em> is
allowed of reed, bamboo, wood, lac (resin), fruit shells, copper, conch-shell.</p>
<p>Receiving and using the improper item when it was requested by oneself (e.g.
given as a surprise gift) is a <em>dukkaṭa</em> offence.</p>

their facial expressions or hear what they say.</p>
<p><em>A secluded seat:</em> concealed behind a wall, a closed door, a large bush.
Sufficient cover for sexual activity.</p>
<p>This is already an offence under <em>Pc 44 (secluded seat)</em>, but this rule also
covers the heavier offences.</p>
<p>The bhikkhu community should investigate, hearing out the relevant individuals,
and deciding on imposing the penalty or not.</p>
<p>They may deal with the bhikkhu only in terms of what he admits having done. They
may cross-question him as a group, until they are satisfied that he is telling
the truth.</p>
<p>The decision must be unanimous, and the bhikkhu in question must accept that his
action was an offence. Otherwise the case has to be left unsettled.</p>

<p>A <em>santhata</em> is a blanket or rug made of felt material. It is made by strewing
the threads over a surface, adding glue, and using a roller to flatten it.</p>
<p>They seem to have been used as a rug for sitting or lying down, or a warm
blanket for cold weather.</p>
<p>Although this type of material not commonly used today, the rules indicate the
proper attitude when obtaining one's requisites, such as warm jackets, personal
blankets, carry bags, suitcases, back packs and so on.</p>
<p><strong>NP 11:</strong> (Unnecessarily expensive) Forbids using silk threads in the material,
an unnecessarily expensive component. After obtaining such a santhata, the
procedure for forfeiture, confession, and receiving the item back is the same.</p>
<p><strong>NP 12:</strong> (Flashy and stylish) Forbids using pure black wool for the material.
This seemed to have been a stylish extravagance.</p>
<p><strong>NP 13:</strong> (Using up the less high-quality materials) When having a new santhata
made, it should contain a mixture of threads: two parts black, third of white,
fourth of brown. The crucial aspect being the mixture not containing more than
one-half of black wool.</p>
<p><strong>NP 14:</strong> (Making it last a long time) A new santhata should last at least six
years. If necessary to obtain another sooner, one may seek the authorization
from the community.</p>
<p><strong>NP 15:</strong> (Re-using the old materials and discolouring the new) When making a
new santhata, a 25cm wide strip of old felt material should be incorporated on
each side.</p>
