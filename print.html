<h3><a class="header" href="#useful-quotes" id="useful-quotes">Useful quotes</a></h3>
<p>&quot;Now, Ananda, if it occurs to any of you -- 'The teaching has lost its
authority; we are without a Teacher' -- do not view it in that way. Whatever
Dhamma and Vinaya I have pointed out and formulated for you, that will be your
Teacher when I am gone.&quot; (DN 16)</p>
<p>&quot;The non-doing of all evil, the performance of what is skillful, and the
purification of one's mind: This is the Buddhas' message.&quot; (Dhp 183)</p>
<p>&quot;On one occasion the Blessed One was living in Vesali, in the Great
Wood. Then a certain Vajjian bhikkhu went to him... and said: 'Venerable
sir, this recitation of more than 150 training rules comes every
fortnight. I cannot train in reference to them.'</p>
<p>'Bhikkhu, can you train in reference to the three trainings: the training in
heightened virtue, the training in heightened mind, the training in heightened
discernment?'</p>
<p>&quot;'Yes, venerable sir, I can....'</p>
<p>'Then train in reference to those three trainings.... Your passion,
aversion, and delusion -- when trained in heightened virtue, heightened
mind, and heightened discernment will be abandoned. You -- with the
abandoning of passion... aversion... delusion -- will not do anything
unskilful or engage in any evil.'&quot;</p>
<p>(AN 3.85)</p>
<p>&quot;'Bhikkhus, this recitation of more than 150 training rules comes every
fortnight, in reference to which sons of good families desiring the goal
train themselves. There are these three trainings under which all that
is gathered. Which three? The training in heightened virtue, the
training in heightened mind, the training in heightened discernment....&quot;</p>
<p>(AN 3.88)</p>
<p>If there is some obstacle to [the practice of the training rules], due to time
and place, the rules should be upheld indirectly and not given up entirely, for
otherwise there will be no principles (for discipline). A community without
principles for discipline cannot last long...</p>

<p><img src="./includes/mindmaps/pr-3.png" alt="Pr-3" /></p>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> bhikkhus develop aversion to the body and kill themselves or
ask an assassin to kill them.</p>
<p>Recommending death or euthanasia can be <strong>parajika</strong> if the instruction is
followed. Hinting fulfils effort, such as &quot;death would be better for you&quot;.</p>
<p>A human being is regarded as such from the time when the 'being to be born' is
established in the womb. This is an uncertain time, sometime after conception
during embryo development. The embryo can't develop otherwise.</p>

<p>Giving an order fulfils effort.</p>
<p><strong>Result</strong> is a factor.</p>
<p>Doesn't include animals smaller than visible to the naked eye. Doesn't
include accidents (sweeping). No room for 'phrasing it right'.</p>
<p>Origin: Ven. Udayin is killing crows by shooting them with arrows, cutting their
heads off and putting them in a row on a stake. The Buddha scolds him, &quot;How can
you, foolish man, intentionally deprive a living thing of life? ...&quot; (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc61/en/horner">Vibh. Pc
61</a>)</p>
<p>Mercy killing by the owner, or euthanasia practices by vets fulfil effort.
Having a pet means responsibility.</p>
<p>Acting in doubt, going ahead anyway is dukkata. Such as when the bhikkhu thinks
that cleaning an item may or may not kill living beings. Trying carefully not to
kill insects while cleaning is not an offence.</p>
<p><strong>Perception</strong> is a factor. Stepping on a twig with the intention to crush a
snake is dukkata.</p>

<p>Knowing they will die from pouring it. It can also include knowingly
adding poisonous substances.</p>
<p>If the water doesn't contain living beings, but the bhikkhu thinks it does,
pouring or using it is dukkata.</p>
<p>Giving an order fulfils effort.</p>
<p>Result is not a factor. Doesn't include accidents.</p>
<p>Can't water plants if one plans to eat its fruit, but may indicate it
for others.</p>
<p>Kutis may use small gutters as water moats around the stilts to keep out ants.
One has to treat the water with household chemicals, otherwise mosquitoes will
breed in the water.</p>

<p><em>(Figure: Overview of the procedure after a Sanghadisesa offence, comparing the
case of immediately informing and concealing.)</em></p>
<p>One doesn't have to wait until one is certain about the offence, speaking to
another bhikkhu about a doubtful situation will at least clear one's conscience
that one is not concealing it.</p>
<p>A bhikkhu who comitted a sanghadisesa must inform another bhikkhu as
soon as possible, but at most until the next dawnrise. The Sangha must
meet and at his request, allow a six-dawn period of penance (<em>mānatta</em>).
If he concealed the offence, a probation period (<em>parivāsa</em>) is required
beforehand.</p>
<p>The Sangha will determine when and where the bhikkhu should observe the
<em>parivāsa</em> and <em>mānatta</em>. These periods are determined by the Sangha and don't
have to occur back-to-back.</p>
<p>After completing <em>mānatta</em> he can only be rehabilitated as a bhikkhu in regular
standing by a community meeting of at least 20 bhikkhus. He is not required to
stay at that particular monaster after having received rehabilitation.</p>
<p>If he commits another sanghadisesa before rehabilitation, he must inform a
bhikkhu and ask a Sangha of at least four to 'send him back to the beginning.'</p>
<p>There is allowance to interrupt and set aside the penance or probation for a
period of time, for example when many visiting monks are expected to arrive at
the monastery for an event.</p>
<p>Characteristic duties during penance:</p>
<ul>
<li>not receiving duties of respect from other bhikkhus</li>
<li>inform visiting bhikkhus that he is undergoing penance</li>
<li>every day, notify every bhikkhu in the monastery of his offence</li>
<li>stay under a separate roof than the other bhikkhus</li>
<li>only leave the monastery when accompanied by four other bhikkhus</li>
</ul>
<p>The duties during probation are the same as during penance, except:</p>
<ul>
<li>inform the Sangha of his offence every fortnight, not every day</li>
<li>only leave the monastery when accompanied by a single other bhikkhu</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#sensual-thoughts" id="sensual-thoughts">Sensual thoughts</a></h3>
<p>Sensual thoughts are not designated a penalty, but they grow quickly and lead to
one's downfall.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The thought occurred to the deva living in the sala tree ... &quot;It's pleasant,
the touch of this maluva creeper's soft, tender, downy tendril.&quot; (MN 45)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When reconizing that one has been caught up in a sensual fantasy, immediately
visualizing <em>asubha</em> of the body can break up the lustful mental state.</p>
<p>Repeatedly training to notice the signs of <em>asubha</em> changes the unconscious
habits of the dreaming mind as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, if a sensual thought, a thought of ill-will, or a thought of harming
arises in a monk while walking, standing, sitting or lying down, and he
tolerates it, does not abandon it, dispel it, terminate it, and obliterate it,
then that monk is said to be devoid of ardour and wise fear of consequences;
he is constantly and continuously lazy and lacking in energy while walking,
standing, sitting or lying down. (AN 4.11)</p>

who repeatedly sends unhappy messages back to her family. (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5/en/brahmali">Vib. Ss. 5</a>)</p>
<p>Only two factors: effort and object.</p>
<p><strong>Effort:</strong> 'Conveying' messages for any romantic purpose from a
momentary date to a wedding. Not business meetings.</p>
<!-- latex

<p>Three stages:</p>

<p>Dukkata for any single stage, thullacaya for any two, sanghadisesa for
all three.</p>
<p>Carrying a letter without knowing the content doesn't fulfill effort.</p>
<p>Keeping email and phone contacts private. Nonetheless it fulfills <em>inquiring</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Object:</strong> A man and a women who are not married to each other, even if

<p><strong>Object:</strong> Female human being, even a baby, one's relative or not.</p>
<p><strong>Effort:</strong> in the instant one lies down in the same dwelling when a
woman is lying down.</p>
<p>Same dwelling: one &quot;enclosure&quot;. Technically the same walls and roof, but
one may consider variations (private hospital rooms).</p>
<p>Intention is not a factor, pacittiya even if the bhikkhu doesn't know
about the woman.</p>
<p>Purpose: to avoid situations where people might think that one may have
commited serious offenses. Other people might see the situation and
rumors would be damaging.</p>
<p>Non-offenses for roofed but no walls (pavilion) or walled but not roofed

seat with a woman? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it...&quot;
(<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc44/en/brahmali">Vibh. Pc. 44</a>)</p>
<p>The bhikkhu sits with a woman at a secluded place, private to the eye and ear,
without another man present, aiming at privacy. Secluded enough for parajika.</p>
<p><strong>Effort:</strong> sitting or lying down on the same seat.</p>

<p>Five great gangsters as bad monks:</p>
<ol>
<li>wanting to be honoured, revered and obtain gifts</li>
<li>learning the Buddha's teachings and taking it as his own</li>
<li>accusing a pure practitioner of the holy life of sexual intercourse</li>
<li>taking and using Sangha property to create a following among lay people</li>
<li>&quot;But in this world this is the greatest gangster: he who untruthfully and
groundlessly boasts about a superhuman quality. Why is that? Monks, you’ve
eaten the country’s almsfood by theft.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Object:</strong> superior human states which are not accessible to mundane, ordinary
people (<em>puthujjana</em>). States are categorized in three groups.</p>
<p><em>Mahaggata dhamma</em>, 'expanded states'. Some are are supra-mundane if they depend
on higher jhanas.</p>
<p><em>Lokuttara dhamma</em>, 'transcendent states'. Always supra-mundane. Related to the
eradication of the mental fetters. Nine: Nibbāna plus the four paths and their
four fruitions.</p>
<p><em>Tiracchāna-vijjā</em>, 'animal knowledge'. Always mundane. Examples are occult
abilities, future-telling, giving protective charms, casting malevolent spells,
psychic healing, practicing as a medium, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Perception:</strong> knowing as non-existent, not present in oneself. If it is a
mistaken claim out of overestimation, that would not be parajika.</p>
<p><em>Non-existent</em> defined as &quot;not to be found; not knowing, not seeing a skillful
state within oneself, (yet saying,) 'There is a skillful state within me.'&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Effort:</strong> Addressing a human being. Speaking about the state withing oneself,
or one being in the state.</p>
<p>Explicit:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I have attained the first jhāna&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I have seen the heavenly realms&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I know my previous lifetimes&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Implicit or idiomatic:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I delight in an empty dwelling&quot; (referring to jhana)</li>
<li>&quot;I have no doubts about the Buddha's teaching&quot; (referring to stream entry)</li>
</ul>
<p>Humblebrag:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I am so dumb that before this retreat I didn't understand jhanas.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I am a really slow learner, but I don't have any doubt that the Buddha is right.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;My meditation is nothing much, but you know, sometime you can see really interesting things...&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Virtue signalling:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I have learnt to bow like this from a real Forest Kruba Ajahn.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Those monks talk about football. How could they have even basic samadhi?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Gestures by agreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;The first who leaves their kuti is an arahant.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>False claims made <em>in thought</em> are assigned a <em>dukkata</em> by the Buddha. (Story:
seen by a bhikkhu who could read minds and a devata.)</p>
<p><strong>Intention:</strong> to misrepresent the truth, motivated by an evil desire.</p>
<ul>
<li>knowing that it is a lie, aiming to misrepresent the truth</li>
<li>motivated by an evil desire</li>
</ul>
<p>Evil desire: that others may think of him as such.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> the understanding of the speaker and the listener.</p>
<p>The bhikkhu must understand that he is making a claim. The listener doesn't have
to understand or recognize it.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#suggested-states" id="suggested-states">Suggested states</a></h3>

<h2><a class="header" href="#pc-1-intentional-lie" id="pc-1-intentional-lie">Pc 1, Intentional lie</a></h2>
<p>Origin: Ven. Hatthaka defeats philosophical opponents by means of lying.</p>
<p><strong>Intention:</strong> to misrepresent the truth</p>
<p><strong>Effort:</strong> to communicate it to sb. based on that aim</p>
<p>Result is not a factor. It doesn't matter if the listener believes it or
not.</p>
<p><em>Telling a conscious lie</em> means: the words, the utterance, the speech,
the talk, the language, the intimation, the (un-ariyan) statements of
the person intent upon deceiving with words.</p>
<p><em>Dukkata</em> for remaining silent when it implies a false message (e.g.
during Patimokka recitation).</p>
<p><em>Dukkata</em> for broken promises, where one is making the promise with pure
intentions but later breaking it.</p>
<p><em>White lies:</em> motivation is irrelevant.</p>
<p><em>Remaining silent:</em></p>
<p>During the patimokkha recitation: pacittiya.</p>
<p>Silence is a gesture, and fulfils effort as a factor.</p>
<p>Everyday context: sensitive information, or can't be bothered to respond.</p>
<p>Example: &quot;We can discuss it tomorrow&quot; -- (a) just to make him
happy but not intending to meet (b) failing to remember or something comes up
blocking the meeting.</p>
<p>One has to know <em>I am going to lie</em>, and <em>I am lying</em>.</p>
<p>Note: irony doesn't intend to deceive, but satire does.</p>
<p>Cruel- or malign jokes: don't let humour comprimise your highest values.</p>
<p>Example: &quot;It was 100!&quot; -- intending to impress, but he doesn't know.</p>
<p>Checking one's statements before making them, different levels of confidence in
a statement.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#jokes" id="jokes">Jokes</a></h3>
<p>Humorous, witty remarks which are true statements are not criticized
even by the Buddha. There are cases of his humour in the suttas.</p>
<p>Irony, sarcasm, satire, boastful- and playful exaggeration are confusing
because one makes physical signs to represent a false statement
(effort).</p>
<p>One may claim not intending to lie, but one's intention is often
ambigous (jolly bantering, wanting to avoid a situation).</p>
<p>Result is not a factor, but others might miss the irony while picking up
the resentment or malice.</p>
<p>The Commentary's examples:</p>
<p>A novice asks a bhikkhu:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you seen my preceptor?</li>
<li>Your preceptor's probably gone, yoked to a firewood cart.</li>
</ul>
<p>A novice, on hearing the yapping of hyenas:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's making that noise?</li>
<li>That's the noise of those who are lifting the stuck-in-the-mud wheel
of the carriage your mother's going in.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Commentary assigns offence for these and other examples which could
be exaggeration or sarcasm.</p>
<p>Note the Buddha's instruction to Rahula: &quot;Train yourself, 'I will not
utter a deliberate lie, even for a laugh.'&quot;</p>
<p>Intention is fulfilled when the speaker wants the listener to believe a
false statement, even if for a second, even while planning to reveal
that one is only joking.</p>
<p>Practical jokes are <em>pacittiya</em> (e.g. telling sb. that their robes are
lost to see their reaction).</p>
<p>Satire and boastful exaggeration are <em>pacittiya</em>.</p>
<p>Irony, sarcasm, playful exaggeration can sometimes fulfill intention,
sometimes not. Such remarks are often made as a manner of speaking
without the intention to deceive.</p>
<p>Example at Pr 2: a bhikkhu puts away sb's item for safe-keeping. When
the person is looking for it, he ironically responds &quot;I stole it.&quot; The
Buddha says the bhikkhu committed no offence, as it was only a manner of
speaking, not an acknowledgement of theft.</p>

<!-- latex
\enlargethispage{2\baselineskip}
-->
<p>Origin: the Buddha sees monks carrying heaps of robes tied on their heads, backs
and hips. He sits outside in February when snow was falling to determine how
many robes are reasonable (set of three). The group of six starts to keep
several sets in different monasteries, so the Buddha sets a limit on keeping the
excess, and allows further cloth to be placed under shared ownership.</p>
<p>Encouraging modesty to avoid hoarding requisites.</p>
<p><strong>Object:</strong> a piece of cloth which <em>could</em> be used for making part of a robe, at
least 10 x 20 cm (4 x 8 in). It has to be a suitable material for <em>bhikkhus</em>.
Leather is unsuitable. Black, blue, crimson are not suitable colours for a robe.</p>
<p><strong>Effort:</strong> keeping it for more than ten days without determining it for
use.</p>
<p><em>Making a robe:</em> they can use cloth from the stores to make a robe for the
community, and later request it during a formal meeting such as <em>uposatha</em>.</p>
<p>Or, they may determine the plain cloth before the sewing project and
re-determine the finished item later.</p>
<p><strong>Perception</strong> is not a factor, mis-counting the days is not an excuse.</p>
<p>If the robe develops a hole, it loses its determination. It has to be
mended within 10 days, and determined for use again.</p>
<p>Holes which are small, or located within a hand-span along the edge
don't cause the determination to lapse, but when mended, may require the
robe to be re-determined.</p>
<p><strong>Robe-season:</strong> 4th lunar month of <em>Vassana</em>, from the full moon in
October. During that time one may receive and keep robe-cloth for more
than ten days.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#np-2-separated-from-robe" id="np-2-separated-from-robe">NP 2, Separated from robe</a></h2>
<p>Origin: bhikkhus go travelling on a tour. They leave their sanghatis behind at
the monastery, where the bhikkhus are burdened with having to keep sunning them
to stop them from getting mouldy.</p>
<p><strong>Object:</strong> either one of the bhikkhu's <em>currently determined</em> three
main robes, the <em>antaravāsaka</em> (sabong, lower robe), <em>uttarāsaṅga</em>
(jiwon, upper robe), and <em>saṅghāṭi</em> (outer robe).</p>
<p>This rule doesn't apply to other cloth requisites, such as a work-sabong
or an old jiwon used as a bedsheet.</p>
<p><strong>Effort:</strong> at dawnrise, being outside of 'the same area' than where one's robes
are located.</p>
<p><em>Dawnrise</em> may be determined by stretching one's hand out and seeing the lines
on one's palm, or by seeing the green colour of the leaves. This approximately
corresponds to the time of <em>nautical twilight</em>, the Sun being 12 to 6 degrees
under the horizon.</p>
<p>'<em>The same area</em>' may be within <em>hatthapasa</em> (arm's reach), in the same
room, building, or the monastery grounds, depending on the local
<em>kor-wat</em>.</p>
<p><em>Eka-kula</em>: 'one family', or one roof, where one person is in charge, with a
clear boundary.</p>
<p><em>Thai kutis</em>: when the bhikkhu is alone, the area is his kuti and hatthapasa
around it. When somebody else is present, hattapasa from his body.</p>
<p>Exception during the robe-season, if one is eligible for <em>kathina</em>*
privileges, and unless one has relinquished those privileges.</p>
<p><strong>Formal meetings:</strong></p>
<p>By ECM custom, bhikkhus should be present with their three main robes on formal
meetings (e.g. uposatha, kathina, ordination).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, <em>sanghakamma</em> would be still valid without bhikkhus having their
three robes.</p>

outside the robe-season.</p>
<p>This rule allows extra robe-cloth to be kept for up to 30 days, when it is not
enough for a robe, and one is expecting to receive more cloth later.</p>

the rain. She returns to Lady Visakha, and tells her that there were no
bhikkhus there, only naked ascetics. She asks the Buddha for permission
to provide rains-bathing cloth for the bhikkhus.</p>
<p>The proper time to seek a rains-bathing cloth is the last month of the
hot season. It may be worn in the last half-month of the hot season and
during the rains season.</p>
<p>One may ask relatives, or supporters who have provided such cloth in the
past.</p>

<p>It is suitable to make three small dots in one corner of the robe,
saying, &quot;<em>Imaṁ bindu-kappaṁ karomi</em>,&quot; (I make this properly marked)
while making each dot.</p>
<p>There is no need to make a new mark if it wears off, or if the robe has

<blockquote>
<p>Luang Pu Mun first asked the visitors how long they have been in the robes, the
monasteries they have practised in and the details of their journey. Did they
have any doubts about the practice? Luang Por Chah replies that he does.</p>
<p>[...] He said he had been studying the Vinaya texts with great enthusiasm but
had become discouraged. The Discipline seemed too detailed to be practical; it
didn’t seem possible to keep every single rule. What should one’s standard be?</p>
<p>Luang Pu Mun listened in silence. Then he gave simple but practical advice. He
advised Luang Por to take the ‘two guardians of the world’ – wise shame (<em>hiri</em>)
and wise fear of consequences (<em>ottappa</em>) – as his basic principles. In the
presence of those two virtues, he said, everything else would follow.</p>

<p>The purpose is to avoid getting mixed up in cases of ownership and value

<h2><a class="header" href="#pc-38-stored-food" id="pc-38-stored-food">Pc 38, Stored food</a></h2>
<p>Origin: The Ven. Belatthasisa keeps the leftover rice from his alms-round and
moistens it the following day, to stay in solitude. Even though the motivation
(frugality) is innocent, the Buddha still rebukes him and recommends going
alms-round every day instead.</p>
<p>The convenince of stored food can lead to lack of effort to train and being
disconnected from reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In the course of the future there will be bhikkhus who will live entangled
with monastery attendants and novices. As they are entangled with monastery
attendants and novices, they can be expected to live intent on many kinds of
stored-up consumables and on making blatant signs (identifying their) land and
crops.&quot; (AN 5.80)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>'Stored-up' means formally received by any bhikkhu, and keeping it beyond the
next dawn.</p>
<p>Relinquishing it to a novice or lay people, who may store and offer it later is
allowed. If the bhikkhu hasn't relinquished it, it is not allowable (dukkata).</p>

<p><strong>Object:</strong> whatever is fit to eat.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#pc-51-intoxicants" id="pc-51-intoxicants">Pc 51, Intoxicants</a></h2>
<p>Origin: Ven. Sāgata awes the lay supporters in Kosambi with his psychic power by
doing battle with a fire-nāga. The supporters ask the bhikkhus what they could
offer or prepare for them. The group of six ask them to prepare liquor. When the
supporters see Ven. Sāgata on alms-round, they offer him liquor house after
house, and he passes out at the city gate. The Buddha and other bhikkhus see
him, and carry him back to the monastery. There, he forgets being deferential to
the Buddha and sleeps in a helpless stupor.</p>
<p><strong>Object:</strong> any alcoholic beverage.</p>
<p>Alcohol is criticized because it destroys one's sense of shame, weakens one's
discernment and can put one into a stupor. Hence this rule is extended to other
