## Pc 54, Disrespectful after admonition

Different offences for showing disrespect:

When the admonition is related to a specific rule in the Vinaya, the offence is *pācittiya*.

When the admonition relates to general behaviour of being self-effacing, scrupolous, etc., the offence is *dukkaṭa*.

The validity of the admonition is not a factor.

Disrespect can be expressed to the rule, to the person, by word or by gesture.

There is no offence in politely discussing that one was taught differently somewhere else.

A ploy to avoid being criticized is *Pc 71*.

## Pc 64, Concealing another's serious offence

A bhikkhu doesn't inform the community about another bhikkhu's serious offence,
possibly out wishing to save him from the consequences or embarrassment.

There is no offence in not informing the community, if one's motivation is not
to hide the offence, but for example waiting to inform the abbot first.

## Pc 65, Ordaining someone less than 20 years old

A person's age here is counted from the time he had become a fetus in her
mother's womb (add six months to the date of birth).

## Pc 68, Not relinquishing an evil view

A bhikkhu wants to do something he knows to be declared improper for him:

> "As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those acts the Blessed
> One says are obstructive, when engaged in are not genuine obstructions."

'Obstructions' include the five *ānantarika-kamma*, persisting in extreme wrong
views and intentional transgression of training rules.

The other bhikkhus should reprimand him. If he relinquishes his view, there is
no penalty.

A bhikkhu who doesn't respond after being formally rebuked, should be suspended.

## Pc 69, Suspended bhikkhu

Other bhikkhus should not commune, affiliate or lie down in the same dwelling
with a suspended bhikkhu.

There is no offence if one knows the bhikkhu has already given up his wrong
view, but has not yet been formally restored.

## Pc 70, Expelled novice

A novice who persists in holding onto such wrong views should be expelled. A
novice may be also expelled when he breaks his precepts habitually and is not
intending to correct his behaviour.

Afterwards, the bhikkhus should not befriend him, receive his services, commune
or lie down with him in the same dwelling.

## Pc 74, Hitting a bhikkhu

Hitting a bhikkhu in anger is a *pācittiya*, an unordained person is a *dukkaṭa*
offence.

It is not a factor whether the other person is hurt or not.

It is not an offence to hit another person when being in physical danger and
wanting to escape.

## Pc 75, Threatening gesture

Raising the palms or making some other threatening gesture out of anger.
