Going to a battlefield to watch an army was a form of entertainment for
non-military citizens. Actual battle was not total warfare, and practice
manuveurs were outside the city.

Modern examples would include watching a public demonstration or a live
bradcast.

**Object:** an army on active duty. This is not only battle.

**Effort:** staying still and watching them is enough.

**Intention:** to watch them. Going to them for a different, suitable
reason is not an offense.

    from danger, invited for alms or to give a talk)
-   having other business, one sees the army
-   seeing them from the monastery
-   the army comes to where one happens to be
-   meeting an army coming from the opposite direction
-   there are dangers
