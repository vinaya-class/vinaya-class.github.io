The ten reasons for the establishing of the Pāṭimokkha:

1.  "For the excellence of the Sangha;
2.  for the wellbeing of the Sangha;
3.  for the control of ill-controlled bhikkhus;
4.  for the comfort of wellbehaved bhikkhus;
5.  for the restraint of the *āsavā* in this present state;
6.  for protection against the *āsavā* in a future state;
7.  to give confidence to those of little faith;
8.  to increase the confidence of the faithful;
9.  to establish the True Dhamma;
10. to support the Vinaya."

(Vin.III.20; A.V.70)

Four things not to be done, *akaraṇīya*:

1.  sexual intercourse: as a man with his head cut off cannot live
2.  theft: as a withered leaf separated from its stalk cannot become
    green again
3.  depriving a human being of life: as a flat stone, broken in half,
    cannot be put together again
4.  claiming false attainments: as a palm tree, cut off at the crown, is
    incapable of further growth
