## Purpose and functional operation of the Vinaya

The ten reasons for the establishing of the Pāṭimokkha, *dasa atthavase*:

1.  "For the excellence of the Sangha;
2.  for the wellbeing of the Sangha;
3.  for the control of ill-controlled bhikkhus;
4.  for the comfort of wellbehaved bhikkhus;
5.  for the restraint of the *āsavā* in this present state;
6.  for protection against the *āsavā* in a future state;
7.  to give confidence to those of little faith;
8.  to increase the confidence of the faithful;
9.  to establish the True Dhamma;
10. to support the Vinaya."

(Vin.III.20; [AN 10.31](https://suttacentral.net/an10.31/en/bodhi))

Four things not to be done, *akaraṇīya*:

1.  sexual intercourse: as a man with his head cut off cannot live
2.  theft: as a withered leaf separated from its stalk cannot become
    green again
3.  depriving a human being of life: as a flat stone, broken in half,
    cannot be put together again
4.  claiming false attainments: as a palm tree, cut off at the crown, is
    incapable of further growth

([Vin.I.96-97](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/horner-brahmali))

A person committing parajika is said to be 'incurable', all other offenses are
'curable'. The person has asked to train, has not given it up, and still commits
the extreme offenses against the training.

*NOTE:* Five years of *nissaya* (dependence on a teacher) after ordination is
integral to the training.

In the monasteries of the Thai tradition, the upajjhāya should fill out and give
a *baisuddhi* document to the bhikkhus he has ordained.

### Useful quotes

"Now, Ananda, if it occurs to any of you -- 'The teaching has lost its
authority; we are without a Teacher' -- do not view it in that way. Whatever
Dhamma and Vinaya I have pointed out and formulated for you, that will be your
Teacher when I am gone." (DN 16)

"The non-doing of all evil, the performance of what is skillful, and the
purification of one's mind: This is the Buddhas' message." (Dhp 183)

"On one occasion the Blessed One was living in Vesali, in the Great
Wood. Then a certain Vajjian bhikkhu went to him... and said: 'Venerable
sir, this recitation of more than 150 training rules comes every
fortnight. I cannot train in reference to them.'

'Bhikkhu, can you train in reference to the three trainings: the training in
heightened virtue, the training in heightened mind, the training in heightened
discernment?'

"'Yes, venerable sir, I can....'

'Then train in reference to those three trainings.... Your passion,
aversion, and delusion -- when trained in heightened virtue, heightened
mind, and heightened discernment will be abandoned. You -- with the
abandoning of passion... aversion... delusion -- will not do anything
unskilful or engage in any evil.'"

(AN 3.85)

"'Bhikkhus, this recitation of more than 150 training rules comes every
fortnight, in reference to which sons of good families desiring the goal
train themselves. There are these three trainings under which all that
is gathered. Which three? The training in heightened virtue, the
training in heightened mind, the training in heightened discernment...."

(AN 3.88)

"There are these two bright qualities that safeguard the world. Which two?
Conscience & concern for the results of unskillful actions (*hiri-ottappa*)."

([Iti 2.15](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/iti/iti.2.028-049.than.html#iti-042))

“What then is the reason why the spiritual life established by Buddha
Kakusandha, Buddha Konāgamana, and Buddha Kassapa lasted long?”

"[...] they laid down training rules and recited a monastic code. [...] It’s just
like flowers tied with a string to a wooden plank: they are not scattered about,
whirled about, or destroyed by the wind. Why is that? Because they are held
together by a string."

([PTS Vin. 3.1–3.40](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali))

If there is some obstacle to [the practice of the training rules], due to time
and place, the rules should be upheld indirectly and not given up entirely, for
otherwise there will be no principles (for discipline). A community without
principles for discipline cannot last long...

(Entrance to the Vinaya, I.230)

## Overview of the rules

- 4 Pārājika: defeat
- 13 Saṅghādisesa: involving community actions
- 2 Aniyata: indefinite result
- 30 Nissaggiya Pācittiya: entailing forfeiture
- 92 Pācittiya: to be confessed
- 4 Pāṭidesaniya: to be acknowledged
- 75 Sekhiya: etiquette to be trained in
- 8 Adhikaraṇa-samatha: means of settling issues

## Hierarchy of Views

Conflicting Dhamma and Vinaya commentaries and local practices can be sorted out by following the hierarchy of views.

1. The word of the Buddha ('I heard this from the Blessed One')
2. The views of the arahant disciples at the 1st and 2nd Council (the Sutta Vibhanga)
3. Commentaries and Sub-commentaries
4. Instructions of one's teacher and local training standards (*kor-wat*)
5. One's personal opinions

One canonical example is when bhikkhus commend the standardized formulation of
the suttas by the 1st Council, but say that they will nonetheless continue
teaching it the way they heard it from the Blessed One.

**Discussion:** Where does the Four Great Standards and the decisions of the
European Elders Council, or the Mahathera Samakorn in Thailand fit in?
