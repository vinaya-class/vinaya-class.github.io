## Purpose and functional operation of the Vinaya

The ten reasons for the establishing of the Pāṭimokkha:

1.  "For the excellence of the Sangha;
2.  for the wellbeing of the Sangha;
3.  for the control of ill-controlled bhikkhus;
4.  for the comfort of wellbehaved bhikkhus;
5.  for the restraint of the *āsavā* in this present state;
6.  for protection against the *āsavā* in a future state;
7.  to give confidence to those of little faith;
8.  to increase the confidence of the faithful;
9.  to establish the True Dhamma;
10. to support the Vinaya."

(Vin.III.20; A.V.70)

Four things not to be done, *akaraṇīya*:

1.  sexual intercourse: as a man with his head cut off cannot live
2.  theft: as a withered leaf separated from its stalk cannot become
    green again
3.  depriving a human being of life: as a flat stone, broken in half,
    cannot be put together again
4.  claiming false attainments: as a palm tree, cut off at the crown, is
    incapable of further growth

### Useful quotes

"Now, Ananda, if it occurs to any of you -- 'The teaching has lost its
authority; we are without a Teacher' -- do not view it in that way. Whatever
Dhamma and Vinaya I have pointed out and formulated for you, that will be your
Teacher when I am gone." (DN 16)

"The non-doing of all evil, the performance of what is skillful, and the
purification of one's mind: This is the Buddhas' message." (Dhp 183)

"On one occasion the Blessed One was living in Vesali, in the Great
Wood. Then a certain Vajjian bhikkhu went to him... and said: 'Venerable
sir, this recitation of more than 150 training rules comes every
fortnight. I cannot train in reference to them.'

'Bhikkhu, can you train in reference to the three trainings: the training in
heightened virtue, the training in heightened mind, the training in heightened
discernment?'

"'Yes, venerable sir, I can....'

'Then train in reference to those three trainings.... Your passion,
aversion, and delusion -- when trained in heightened virtue, heightened
mind, and heightened discernment will be abandoned. You -- with the
abandoning of passion... aversion... delusion -- will not do anything
unskilful or engage in any evil.'"

(AN 3.85)

"'Bhikkhus, this recitation of more than 150 training rules comes every
fortnight, in reference to which sons of good families desiring the goal
train themselves. There are these three trainings under which all that
is gathered. Which three? The training in heightened virtue, the
training in heightened mind, the training in heightened discernment...."

(AN 3.88)

If there is some obstacle to [the practice of the training rules], due to time
and place, the rules should be upheld indirectly and not given up entirely, for
otherwise there will be no principles (for discipline). A community without
principles for discipline cannot last long...

(Entrance to the Vinaya, I.230)
