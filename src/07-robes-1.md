## NP 1, Keeping robe cloth for more than 10 days

<!-- latex
\enlargethispage{2\baselineskip}
-->

Origin: the Buddha sees monks carrying heaps of robes tied on their heads, backs
and hips. He sits outside in February when snow was falling to determine how
many robes are reasonable (set of three). The group of six starts to keep
several sets in different monasteries, so the Buddha sets a limit on keeping the
excess, and allows further cloth to be placed under shared ownership.

Encouraging modesty to avoid hoarding requisites.

**Object:** a piece of cloth which *could* be used for making part of a robe, at
least 10 x 20 cm (4 x 8 in). It has to be a suitable material for *bhikkhus*.
Leather is unsuitable. Black, blue, crimson are not suitable colours for a robe.

**Effort:** keeping it for more than ten days without determining it for
use.

*Making a robe:* they can use cloth from the stores to make a robe for the
community, and later request it during a formal meeting such as *uposatha*.

Or, they may determine the plain cloth before the sewing project and
re-determine the finished item later.

**Perception** is not a factor, mis-counting the days is not an excuse.

If the robe develops a hole, it loses its determination. It has to be
mended within 10 days, and determined for use again.

Holes which are small, or located within a hand-span along the edge
don't cause the determination to lapse, but when mended, may require the
robe to be re-determined.

**Robe-season:** 4th lunar month of *Vassana*, from the full moon in
October. During that time one may receive and keep robe-cloth for more
than ten days.

## NP 2, Separated from robe

Origin: bhikkhus go travelling on a tour. They leave their sanghatis behind at
the monastery, where the bhikkhus are burdened with having to keep sunning them
to stop them from getting mouldy.

**Object:** either one of the bhikkhu's *currently determined* three
main robes, the *antaravāsaka* (sabong, lower robe), *uttarāsaṅga*
(jiwon, upper robe), and *saṅghāṭi* (outer robe).

This rule doesn't apply to other cloth requisites, such as a work-sabong
or an old jiwon used as a bedsheet.

**Effort:** at dawnrise, being outside of 'the same area' than where one's robes
are located.

*Dawnrise* may be determined by stretching one's hand out and seeing the lines
on one's palm, or by seeing the green colour of the leaves. This approximately
corresponds to the time of *nautical twilight*, the Sun being 12 to 6 degrees
under the horizon.

'*The same area*' may be within *hatthapasa* (arm's reach), in the same
room, building, or the monastery grounds, depending on the local
*kor-wat*.

*Eka-kula*: 'one family', or one roof, where one person is in charge, with a
clear boundary.

*Thai kutis*: when the bhikkhu is alone, the area is his kuti and hatthapasa
around it. When somebody else is present, hattapasa from his body.

Exception during the robe-season, if one is eligible for *kathina**
privileges, and unless one has relinquished those privileges.

**Formal meetings:**

By ECM custom, bhikkhus should be present with their three main robes on formal
meetings (e.g. uposatha, kathina, ordination).

Nonetheless, *sanghakamma* would be still valid without bhikkhus having their
three robes.

## NP 3, Out of season robe cloth

One may receive robes at any time, but keep it undetermined for only 10 days
outside the robe-season.

This rule allows extra robe-cloth to be kept for up to 30 days, when it is not
enough for a robe, and one is expecting to receive more cloth later.

## NP 6, Asking for robe cloth

Asking a lay supporter who is not a relative, for robe-cloth, except
when one's robes have been stolen or destroyed.

A bhikkhu who arrives at a monastery with no cloth to cover himself may
take any cloth he finds to wear, if he intends to return it when he
obtains a proper robe.

## NP 7, Excess robe cloth

When one's robes have been stolen or destroyed, one may ask for cloth at
most the amount enough for an upper- and lower robe.

There is no offence for accepting cloth when the donors are offering it
for a different reason.

## NP 8, Request to improve robe

<!-- latex
\enlargethispage{2\baselineskip}
-->

An unrelated householder wishes to purchase robes for the bhikkhu, and
he suggests purchasing a more expensive one.

No offence when the lay person is a relative, or has invited one to ask
for cloth.

## NP 9, Request to combine robe funds

As NP 8, but in this case two householders are offering to sponsor
individual pieces of robe, and the bhikkhu suggests them to purchase a
more expensive robe by combining their funds.
