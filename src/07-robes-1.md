## NP 1, Keeping robe cloth for more than 10 days

Encouraging modesty to avoid hoarding requisites.

**Object:** a piece of cloth which *could* be used for making part of a
robe, at least 4 x 8 inches.

It has to be a suitable material for *bhikkhus*. Leather is unsuitable.
Black, blue, crimson are not suitable colours for a robe.

**Effort:** keeping it for more than ten days without determining it for
use.

**Perception** is not a factor, mis-counting the days is not an excuse.

If the robe develops a hole, it loses its determination. It has to be
mended within 10 days, and determined for use again.

Holes which are small, or located within a hand-span along the edge
don't cause the determination to lapse, but when mended, may require the
robe to be re-determined.

**Robe-season:** 4th lunar month of *Vassana*, from the full moon in
October. During that time one may receive and keep robe-cloth for more
than ten days.

## NP 2, Separated from robe

**Object:** either one of the bhikkhu's *currently determined* three
main robes, the *antaravāsaka* (sabong, lower robe), *uttarāsaṅga*
(jiwon, upper robe), and *saṅghāṭi* (outer robe).

This rule doesn't apply to other cloth requisites, such as a work-sabong
or an old jiwon used as a bedsheet.

**Effort:** at dawnrise (civil twilight), being outside of 'the same
area' than where one's robes are located.

'*The same area*' may be within *hatthapasa* (arm's reach), in the same
room, building, or the monastery grounds, depending on the local
*kor-wat*.

Exception during the robe-season, if one is eligible for *kathina*
privileges, and unless one has relinquished those privileges.

## NP 3, Out of season robe cloth

Extra robe-cloth may be kept for up to 30 days, when it is not enough
for a robe, and one is expecting to receive more cloth later.

## NP 6, Asking for robe cloth

Asking a lay supporter who is not a relative, for robe-cloth, except
when one's robes have been stolen or destroyed.

A bhikkhu who arrives at a monastery with no cloth to cover himself may
take any cloth he finds to wear, if he intends to return it when he
obtains a proper robe.

## NP 7, Excess robe cloth

When one's robes have been stolen or destroyed, one may ask for cloth at
most the amount enough for an upper- and lower robe.

There is no offence for accepting cloth when the donors are offering it
for a different reason.

## NP 8, Request to improve robe

An unrelated householder wishes to purchase robes for the bhikkhu, and
he suggests purchasing a more expensive one.

No offence when the lay person is a relative, or has invited one to ask
for cloth.

## NP 9, Request to combine robe funds

As NP 8, but in this case two householders are offering to sponsor
individual pieces of robe, and the bhikkhu suggests them to purchase a
more expensive robe by combining their funds.
