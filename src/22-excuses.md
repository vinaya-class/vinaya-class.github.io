## Pc 71, Ploy to avoid criticism

A bhikkhu has been admonished in the training, but he doesn't want to train in line with the rule.

**Effort:** one says something to the effect that one will not train in line with the rule.

"Is this the Vinaya, or just your opinion? I have my own interpretation. I am going to ask someone else what they think."

After being admonishmed, the correct response is to accept the instruction and train accordingly, and ask questions at a suitable time after due reflection.

Related to *Pc 54*, being disrespectful after admonition.

## Pc 72, Criticising the rules

Origin: the bhikkhus are holding Vinaya classes with Ven. Upāli, and the
group-of-six are concerned that if everyone knows the rules, they can't do as
they like. They criticize the Vinaya to the other bhikkhus.

To criticize the Dhamma in a similar way is a *dukkaṭa*.

## Pc 73, Claiming ignorance

To pretend that one didn't know about a rule to excuse oneself of its consequences is a *dukkaṭa*.
The other bhikkhus may expose the deception. If he continues to pretend ignorance, the offense is a *pācittiya*.
