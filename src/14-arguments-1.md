## Sg 10, Schismatic group

A schismatic group forms when bhikkhus, who would previously observe the
*Pāṭimokkha* recitation and conduct community meetings together when living in
the same territory, conduct them separately.

*Origin:* The Kosambī dispute (*Mv.X*) and Devadatta's schism (Cv.VII).

When a bhikkhu is agitating for a schism, it is the duty of the other bhikkhus
to reprimand him. If they don't, they incur a *dukkaṭa*. If he is not
reprimanded, he is free to continue without incurring a penalty.

The protocol:

- reprimand him 3 times, informally
- admonish him 3 times at a formal community meeting
- recite a rebuke with one motion and three announcements

He only incurs the *saṅghādisesa* after the last announcement.

The same protocol of reprimand, admonishment and rebuke applies to *Sg 11, 12, 13*.

*Note:* discuss the procedure and valid reasons for declaring a bhikkhu *persona non grata*.

## Sg 11, Supporting a schismatic group

Dealing with bhikkhus who begin to support one who is agitating for a schism,
before their group grows to four.

## Sg 12, Not accepting admonishment

Dealing with a bhikkhu who is 'impossible to speak to' regarding his conduct.

## Sg 13, Not accepting a rebuke or banishment

Dealing with a bhikkhu who is a 'corrupter of families', causing them to stop
supporting bhikkhus of good conduct.

*Origin:* Members of the group-of-six train their lay supporters in a corrupt
culture. As a result they favoured socializing, easy-going, frivolous and chatty
monks, and withdrew support from bhikkhus behaving with restraint.

## Pc 9, Telling an unordained person about serious offence

Serious offence: *pārājika* or *saṅghādisesa*.

Reporting on other offences are a *dukkaṭa* offence.

The purpose of the rule is to protect both ordained and unordained people.

An unordained person's offences are a *dukkaṭa* offence to report on, such as
breaking the Five Precepts.

The community may authorize informing the lay people, if that might to improve a
difficult situation, by unanimous agreement through *apalokana-kamma*.

**Perception** is not a mitigating factor.

**Effort:** The statement has to include both the action and the class of
offence: 'He had his meal past midday, which is a *pācittiya* offence'.

Discrediting a fellow bhikkhu is grounds for Pc 13. When lay people ask why is a
community member standing at the end of the line, it is better to say 'he is
undergoing a procedure defined in the monastic code'.

## Pc 12, Evasive reply

A bhikkhu wants to hide his offences when being formally questioned, by
responding evasively. He might try changing the topic, keep asking questions, or
making unrelated statements.

*Perception* is not a mitigating factor. ('I just said what I thought, I didn't want to confuse anyone.')

An evasive reply or remaining silent when questioned is a *dukkaṭa*. The
community then may make a formal charge of evasive speech. If he continues, the
offence is *pācittiya*.

It is not an offence to remain silent when:

- not understanding what is being said
- too ill to speak
- feeling that speaking will create conflict or turn people against each other
- feeling that the community is not going to act fairly or according to the rule

## Pc 13, Criticising community official

The Buddha gave allowance for the bhikkhu community to organize their duties by
appointing officials in roles such as:

- distributing food
- assigning lodgings
- keeping meal invitation rosters
- kitchen liaison
- etc.

The official should conduct his duties without bias.

**Perception** is not a factor, e.g. as to the whether he was authorized
properly or not, whether he is biased or not.

One's **Intention** is to make him lose face, status, or feel embarrassed.

**Effort** is criticizing or complaining to another bhikkhu with this intention.

Insulting him face-to-face is *Pc 2*, whether he is biased or not.

### Non-offences

It is not an offence to voice criticism when the official is habitually acting
out of bias -- desire, aversion, delusion or fear.

Such as favouritism when assigning the best dwellings to bhikkhus he likes, or
regular confusion when communicating with lay supporters who bring food offerings.

If one criticises a community official as being unfair, but it turns out that he
was fair (following established procedure), and it was the *complainer* who was
acting out of disappointment (didn't get what he wanted), the offence is
incurred.
