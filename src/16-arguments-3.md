## Pc 77, Provoking anxiety

Telling a bhikkhu that he might have broken a rule, or otherwise deliberately
provoking his anxiety, thinking, 'This way, even for just a moment, he will have
no peace.'

*Result* is a factor, the bhikkhu has to experience anxiety even for a moment.

There is no offense in discussing offenses out of genuine concern, or for the
sake of clarifying the training.

## Pc 78, Eavesdropping

Deliberately listening in while others are in argument or other discussion, only
for the sake of using what they say against them, even if only for making them
feel embarrassed.

Reading a bhikkhu's private documents (papers, files, emails) also fulfils **Effort**.

When one has business to do where some others are debating an issue, one should
cough or otherwise signal being present.

## Pc 63, Reopen a closed issue

Relevant issues may be disputes, accusations, offenses, or relating to duties.

The purpose of the rule is to avoid burdening and encumbering a community, only
to satisfy one bhikkhu's personal agenda.

Once an issue has been discussed and dealt with properly, agitating to re-open
it fulfils **Effort**: 'They are inexperienced and dealt with it poorly. That's
not the way to do it.'

**Intention:** one knows that the issue was dealt with properly (but perhaps is
not content to follow the agreement).

The rule applies to decisions in the past, or when one was not present at the
meeting. One implicitly agrees to such established decisions by asking to live
at a monastery, expressed by asking for dependence (*nissaya*) and other protocols.

### Non-offenses

- Re-opening an issue when it was in fact not dealt with properly
  - not in accordance with the rules, decision by an incomplete group,
    unjustified penalties, etc.
- New matters arising out of old decisions are new issues

## Pc 79, Complaining about a community decision

*Origin:* Some group-of-six bhikkhus don't want to go to a meeting and send
their consent (*chanda*). The bhikkhus use the opportunity to make a decision
against them. The group-of-six bhikkhus complain that they wouldn't have
consented to *that*.

Community transactions have to be carried out with all the bhikkhus present, who
are currently within the monastery area. The Pāṭimokkha recitation at the
*uposatha-kamma* is one example.

There is allowance for one to be absent (such as when being too sick) by sending
one's consent (*chanda*) to whatever decisions are made at the meeting.

A valid transaction has to be carried out by a complete assembly, in order to
prevent small factions making independent decisions.

"All the bhikkhus of common affiliation within the territory are either present
at the meeting (sitting within *hatthapāsa*) or have given their consent by
proxy, and no one -- in the course of the transaction -- makes a valid protest
against its being carried out." (Mv.IX.3.5-6)

### Non-offenses

- the decision was not in accordance with the rule
- incomplete assembly
- unjustified penalties

## Pc 80, Leaving a community meeting

*Origin:* one group-of-six bhikkhu leaves a meeting in order to prevent a
transaction being carried out against him.

In order for the transaction relating to a bhikkhu be valid, has to be either
present or given his consent.

**Effort:** he goes beyond *hatthapāsa* of the bhikkhus in the meeting without
first giving his consent.

There is no offense if one leaves the meeting for a different purpose, such as
being ill, can't wait to use the toilet, or thinking 'I'll be right back.'

Nonetheless, it is better to give one's consent before leaving the meeting.

Leaving the Pāṭimokkha recitation and coming back (e.g. toilet break) doesn't
invalidate the *uposathakamma*, and the recitation does not have to be started
from the beginning. The group may wait for the bhikkhu to return before making
decisions, so that they can carry out other *saṅghakamma* together.

The reason for joining a *saṅghakamma* is generally avoided is that when a
larger group of bhikkhus is joining a smaller group, they could overrule
decisions.

## Pc 81, Complaining about favouritism

The community is not allowed to transfer the ownership of *garubhaṇḍa* articles
(land, dwelling, furniture, expensive tools, etc.) to individual bhikkhus.

Light or inexpensive (*lahubhaṇḍa*) articles may be given to an individual with
the proper procedure.

There may be a formal meeting and community transaction, or an informal meeting
where the community members may object.

Complaining after one *has not* objected to the article being given to an
individual, fulfils **Effort**.

There is no offense to complain out of valid concerns (as in *Pc 13*,
criticizing a community official), such as habitual favouritism, anger, delusion
or fear, which means the transaction was invalid.
