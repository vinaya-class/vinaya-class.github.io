## NP 10, Fund with steward

The purpose of the rule is to free bhikkhus from the complex responsibilities of
buying and selling, while facilitating the means and protocols for their support
with money.

A bhikkhu is not allowed to accept other funds either, such as jewels,
commodities, land, livestock, etc.

A bhikkhu may designate a lay steward to manage funds offered for the bhikkhu's
support.

If the bhikkhu harasses the steward with impatient prompting, even if he obtains
the requisite, the item must be forfeited and the NP offence confessed.

If the bhikkhu exceeds the number of allowed promptings, he incurs the NP
offence when obtaining the item.

A verbal prompting may be substituted with two silent ones: from 6 verbal and 0
silent, to 0 verbal and 12 silent.

If the steward fails to use the funds to support the bhikkhu, he should inform the donors.

When speaking with the steward, the bhikkhu should indicate what he needs, but
may not use commands to tell them, 'Give me an X, get an X for me with the fund'.

Funds for the Sangha or a group follow the same protocols.

Funds set up for one kind of *lahubhaṇḍa* may be used for another kind, with a
decision via *apalokana-kamma*.

Funds set up for *garubhaṇḍa* (lodgings, furniture, etc.) may not be diverted for
*lahubhaṇḍa*, but NP 20 allows the community to arrange *garubhaṇḍa* to be sold
and purchase *lahubhaṇḍa*.

In the case of invitations, follow the four-month period protocol in Pc 47.

There is no exemption for relatives or people who have invited the bhikkhu to ask.

**Object:** A fund left with a steward to buy robe cloth, or any fund for any
type of requisite (including construction or book printing).

**Steward:** a layperson or entity responsible for handling funds or
transactions on behalf of a bhikkhu or group of bhikkhus.

Three types of stewards:

- Indicated by the bhikkhu
  - The bhikkhu points the person out
  - The donor gives funds to the steward and tells the bhikkhu
- Indicated by the donor or messenger
  - The donor or messenger chooses the steward and tells the bhikkhu
- Indicated by neither
  - Someone overhears the conversation and volunteers to act as steward
  - The donor gives funds to the steward, but doesn't tell the bhikkhu

### Protocol for accepting funds

Allowable: 

If you are asked who the steward is and you point out a layperson and say, "That
person is the steward".

Unallowable: 

- Accepting money (see NP 18). You should tell the donor that bhikkhus don't
  accept money.
- If a donor asks you who your steward is and you say, "Give it to him" or "He
  will keep it" (see NP 18).
- If a donor asks you who your steward is and you say, "He will buy it" or "He
  will get it in exchange" (see NP 20).
- If the donor asks, "Who should I give this to?" and you point someone out. A
  wise policy instead is to broach the topic of stewards so that the donor asks
  a question to which you may give an allowable answer.
  
## NP 18, Gold, silver and money

A bhikkhu is forbidden to accept gifts of money, getting others to accept them,
or consent to it being placed next to him.

*Perception* is not a mitigating factor.

*Intention* is not a mitigating factor. The bhikkhu may not accept the money for
someone else's sake.

When informing lay supporters who wish to make a donation, the proper language
should be used, i.e. not giving them instruction what to do with their money.

If the donor does not intend the money for the bhikkhu (i.e. offering it to
support the monastery in general), it is not an offence to allow them to place
the money next to the bhikkhu.

If someone drops money into a bhikkhu's bowl against his protest, he may ask
someone to remove it without an offence.

The term 'gold or silver' includes the materials, and whatever is used as currency.

A currency is:

- used for the purpose of general exchange
- have a standardized value
- presentable by any bearer

Not a currency:

- a money order or check made out to a specific person
- credit- and debit cards
- a store's voucher, gift card, or discount points
- food stamps
- promissory notes

Credit cards are not a currency, but are not allowable to use (see NP 20).

There is no offence for a bhikkhu, in the monastery, to pick up gold or money
and put it away for safe keeping.

## NP 19, Selling or buying

This covers the case when a bhikkhu would instruct someone else to arrange the
trade, without himself accepting the money.

There is no allowance for 'wording things right' (*kappiya-vohāra*).

A bhikkhu may not instruct a steward to sell something or invest money for
profit.

## NP 20, Trade

Exchange of items with lay people or members of other sects.

*Origin:* Ven. Upananda exchanges a nicely made robe for a cloak with a
wanderer, who later regrets the trade and wants it back.

Credit cards or checks don't count as currency, but any trade arranged with them
would come under this rule.

### Non-offences

- asking for the price
- informing the steward or seller (e.g. "I have this. I need X") and letting the
  steward or seller arrange the exchange
- if the other person is a bhikkhus or novice
- saying, "Give X for Y" when engaging in trade with your parents
- telling the steward, "Don't take it" when you think the steward is getting a
  bad deal
