## Pc 1, Intentional lie

Origin: Ven. Hatthaka defeats philosophical opponents by means of lying.

**Intention:** to misrepresent the truth

**Effort:** to communicate it to sb. based on that aim

Result is not a factor. It doesn't matter if the listener believes it or
not.

*Telling a conscious lie* means: the words, the utterance, the speech,
the talk, the language, the intimation, the (un-ariyan) statements of
the person intent upon deceiving with words.

*Dukkata* for remaining silent when it implies a false message (e.g.
during Patimokka recitation).

*Dukkata* for broken promises, where one is making the promise with pure
intentions but later breaking it.

*White lies:* motivation is irrelevant.

*Remaining silent:*

During *sanghakamma* when agreement is signalled by silence, if one remains
silent as a deception: pacittiya.

Silence is a gesture, and fulfils effort as a factor.

Everyday context: sensitive information, or can't be bothered to respond.

Example: "We can discuss it tomorrow" -- (a) just to make him
happy but not intending to meet (b) failing to remember or something comes up
blocking the meeting.

One has to know *I am going to lie*, and *I am lying*.

Note: irony doesn't intend to deceive, but satire does. Consider an April Fool's
joke, which fully intends to deceive.

Cruel- or malign jokes: don't let humour comprimise your highest values.

Example: "It was over 9000!" -- intending to impress, but he doesn't know.

Checking one's statements before making them, different levels of confidence in
a statement.

### Jokes

Humorous, witty remarks which are true statements are not criticized
even by the Buddha. There are cases of his humour in the suttas.

Irony, sarcasm, satire, boastful- and playful exaggeration are confusing
because one makes physical signs to represent a false statement
(effort).

One may claim not intending to lie, but one's intention is often
ambigous (jolly bantering, wanting to avoid a situation).

Result is not a factor, but others might miss the irony while picking up
the resentment or malice.

The Commentary's examples:

A novice asks a bhikkhu:

-   Have you seen my preceptor?
-   Your preceptor's probably gone, yoked to a firewood cart.

A novice, on hearing the yapping of hyenas:

-   What's making that noise?
-   That's the noise of those who are lifting the stuck-in-the-mud wheel
    of the carriage your mother's going in.

The Commentary assigns offence for these and other examples which could
be exaggeration or sarcasm.

Note the Buddha's instruction to Rahula: "Train yourself, 'I will not
utter a deliberate lie, even for a laugh.'"

Intention is fulfilled when the speaker wants the listener to believe a
false statement, even if for a second, even while planning to reveal
that one is only joking.

Practical jokes are *pacittiya* (e.g. telling sb. that their robes are
lost to see their reaction).

Satire and boastful exaggeration are *pacittiya*.

Irony, sarcasm, playful exaggeration can sometimes fulfill intention,
sometimes not. Such remarks are often made as a manner of speaking
without the intention to deceive.

Example at Pr 2: a bhikkhu puts away sb's item for safe-keeping. When
the person is looking for it, he ironically responds "I stole it." The
Buddha says the bhikkhu committed no offence, as it was only a manner of
speaking, not an acknowledgement of theft.

## Sg 8, Unfounded parajika accusation

It matters whether the person is present or not.

**Intention:** wanting to remove him from the community. Even when it is 'for
the purity of the Sangha', it is driven by aversion.

Insult, slander, lying.

Spreading stories. Saying something which may be false, but you believe it to be true.

"Not sure if this is true..." -- engaging in gossip, idle chatter, or false tale
bearing (Pc 1) are not accusations, the person is not present.

Discuss reporting on offences.

## Sg 9, Distorting evidence

Finding a statement which will be misinterpreted, but one can maintain it to be
true.

E.g. quoting out of context is creating a false pretext.

## Pc 76, Unfounded sanghadisesa accusation

To fulfil **Effort**, The accusation has to be made either in his presence, or getting someone to accuse him in his presence.

Unfounded accusations about his bad conduct or wrong views is a *dukkaṭa*.

Follow 'face-to-face verdict' (*sammukhāvinayo dātabbo*) when settling the
matter. The community should hear out both parties, not make decisions about
them without them being present.

See [AN 9.11](https://suttacentral.net/an9.11/en/sujato) where a monk accuses
Ven. Sāriputta of hitting him and walking away. The Buddha convenes the
community to hear them out.

## NP 30, Diverting an offering for oneself

Origin: a donor is preparing to give robes to the community. Bhikkhus from
the group-of-six convince the donors to give the robes to them instead.

**Perception** is a factor, one must know that the item is already allocated.
There is no offence if one didn't know.

After forfeiting the item, the bhikkhu will receive it back. The community may
decide if the item is unsuitable for a bhikkhu to use.

## Pc 82, Diverting an offering for a lay person

In this case, a bhikkhu might hear that somebody wishes to give an item to A,
but he convinces them to give it to B instead. This case can be extended even to
common animals. It is inappropriate behaviour for a bhikkhu, supported by freely
given gifts, to interfere with the freedom of donors in giving freely without
expectations.

There is no offence if the bhikkhu was asked for advice. One may answer, "Give
wherever your gift would be used, or would be well-cared for, or would last
long, or wherever your mind feels inspired."

No offence if the bhikkhu doesn't know that the item was already allocated.
