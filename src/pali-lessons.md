# Pāli Lessons

**NOTE:** Lesson downloads moved to: <https://pali-sutta-readings.github.io/pali-lessons/>

These lessons can be used for Pāli self-study or included among the group classes during a Vinaya study period.

The material focuses on the language forms used in the Pāṭimokkha and the Suttas, and introduces Pāli readings from the rules and examples from the daily chants which bhikkhus have already memorized.

One lesson may take more than one session to study with a group. We found that the material in one lesson can be covered in 3 or 4 sessions, each 1 hour long.

Someone familiar with the language may explain the grammar points, while the others may take turns in solving the exercises.
