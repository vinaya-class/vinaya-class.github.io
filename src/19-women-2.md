# Women 2

-   **Ay 1,** sitting privately with a woman
-   **Ay 2,** sitting out of earshot with a woman
-   **Bhikkhunīs,** summary of related rules: NP 4-5, NP 17, Pc 21-30, Pd 1-2.

## Ay 1, sitting privately with a woman

The *aniyata* (indefinite) rules highlight two difficult situations and require
the community to examine them, instead of assigning a definite offence.

*Origin:* Lady Visākhā sees the Ven. Udāyin sitting at a concealed place with a
girl who is newly married.

> 'It is unfitting, venerable sir, and improper, for the master to sit in private,
> alone with a woman [...] Even though the master may not be aiming at that act,
> cynical people are hard to convince.'

A *woman* here means a female human being, 'even one born that very day, all the
more an older one.'

*Sitting:* The situation includes lying down.

*Private:* Private to the eye and ear, *and* concealed. No one else can see
their facial expressions or hear what they say.

*A secluded seat:* concealed behind a wall, a closed door, a large bush.
Sufficient cover for sexual activity.

This is already an offence under *Pc 44 (secluded seat)*, but this rule also
covers the heavier offences.

The bhikkhu community should investigate, hearing out the relevant individuals,
and deciding on imposing the penalty or not.

They may deal with the bhikkhu only in terms of what he admits having done. They
may cross-question him as a group, until they are satisfied that he is telling
the truth.

The decision must be unanimous, and the bhikkhu in question must accept that his
action was an offence. Otherwise the case has to be left unsettled.

## Ay 2, sitting out of earshot with a woman

*Origin:* Lady Visākhā sees the Ven. Udāyin sitting again with that girl,
private to the eye and ear but now *not* concealed.

A *woman* here means one who can recognize lewd remarks.
