## Pc 1, Intentional lie

Origin: Ven. Hatthaka defeats philosophical opponents by means of lying.

**Intention:** to misrepresent the truth

**Effort:** to communicate it to sb. based on that aim

Result is not a factor. It doesn't matter if the listener believes it or
not.

*Telling a conscious lie* means: the words, the utterance, the speech,
the talk, the language, the intimation, the (un-ariyan) statements of
the person intent upon deceiving with words.

*Dukkata* for remaining silent when it implies a false message (e.g.
during Patimokka recitation).

*Dukkata* for broken promises, where one is making the promise with pure
intentions but later breaking it.

### Jokes

Humorous, witty remarks which are true statements are not criticized
even by the Buddha. There are cases of his humour in the suttas.

Irony, sarcasm, satire, boastful- and playful exaggeration are confusing
because one makes physical signs to represent a false statement
(effort).

One may claim not intending to lie, but one's intention is often
ambigous (jolly bantering, wanting to avoid a situation).

Result is not a factor, but others might miss the irony while picking up
the resentment or malice.

The Commentary's examples:

A novice asks a bhikkhu:

-   Have you seen my preceptor?
-   Your preceptor's probably gone, yoked to a firewood cart.

A novice, on hearing the yapping of hyenas:

-   What's making that noise?
-   That's the noise of those who are lifting the stuck-in-the-mud wheel
    of the carriage your mother's going in.

The Commentary assigns offence for these and other examples which could
be exaggeration or sarcasm.

Note the Buddha's instruction to Rahula: "Train yourself, 'I will not
utter a deliberate lie, even for a laugh.'"

Intention is fulfilled when the speaker wants the listener to believe a
false statement, even if for a second, even while planning to reveal
that one is only joking.

Practical jokes are *pacittiya* (e.g. telling sb. that their robes are
lost to see their reaction).

Satire and boastful exaggeration are *pacittiya*.

Irony, sarcasm, playful exaggeration can sometimes fulfill intention,
sometimes not. Such remarks are often made as a manner of speaking
without the intention to deceive.

Example at Pr 2: a bhikkhu puts away sb's item for safe-keeping. When
the person is looking for it, he ironically responds "I stole it." The
Buddha says the bhikkhu committed no offence, as it was only a manner of
speaking, not an acknowledgement of theft.
