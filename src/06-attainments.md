## Pr 4, Lying about superior attainments

Extreme case of lying (Pc 1).

Origin: During a period of drought and famine, certain bhikkhus praised each other's false attainments to the lay people so that they may have a comfortable Vassa. ([Vibh. Pr 4](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4/en/brahmali))

> How can you for the sake of your stomachs praise one another’s superhuman
> qualities to lay people? It would be better for your bellies to be cut open
> with a sharp butcher’s knife than for you to praise one another’s superhuman
> qualities to lay people.
>
> Why is that? Because for that reason you might die or experience death-like
> suffering, but you wouldn’t because of that be reborn in a bad destination.
> But for *this* reason you might.

Five great gangsters as bad monks:

1. wanting to be honoured, revered and obtain gifts
2. learning the Buddha's teachings and taking it as his own
3. accusing a pure practitioner of the holy life of sexual intercourse
4. taking and using Sangha property to create a following among lay people
5. 'But in this world this is the greatest gangster: he who untruthfully and groundlessly boasts about a superhuman quality. Why is that? Monks, you’ve eaten the country’s almsfood by theft.'

**Object:** superior human states which are not accessible to mundane, ordinary people (*puthujjana*). States are categorized in three groups.

*Mahaggata dhamma*, 'expanded states'. Some are supra-mundane if they depend on higher jhānas.

Terms: *jhāna* (absorption), *samāpatti* (attainments), *vipassana* (insight), *samatha* (tranquillity). *Jhāyati* (verb) in the Canon has simple meaning: (1) thinks about (2) meditates; contemplates.

One may avoid confusion about terms by describing the five factors of *jhāna*, rather than using the term on its own.

*Lokuttara dhamma*, 'transcendent states'. Always supra-mundane. Related to the eradication of the mental fetters. Nine: Nibbāna plus the four paths and their four fruitions.

*Tiracchāna-vijjā*, 'animal knowledge'. Always mundane. Examples are occult abilities, future-telling, giving protective charms, casting malevolent spells, psychic healing, practicing as a medium, etc.

**Perception:** knowing as non-existent, not present in oneself. If it is a mistaken claim out of overestimation, that would not be parajika.

*Non-existent* defined as 'not to be found; not knowing, not seeing a skillful state within oneself, (yet saying,) "There is a skillful state within me."'

**Effort:** Addressing a human being. Speaking about the state present within oneself, or one being in the state. Talking to oneself about it is a *dukkaṭa* offense.

Explicit:

- 'I have attained the first jhāna'
- 'I have seen the heavenly realms'
- 'I know my previous lifetimes'

Implicit or idiomatic:

- 'I delight in an empty dwelling' (referring to jhāna)
- 'I have no doubts about the Buddha's teaching' (referring to stream entry)

Gestures by agreement:

- 'The first who leaves their kuti is an arahant.'

**False claims made in thought:**

The general principle applies that the mere arising of a thought or mind-state is not an offense (See *Pr 2:* a bhikkhu, seeing an expensive garment, feels the desire to steal it).

Deliberately cultivating such thoughts or mind-states are nonetheless critized (e.g. one who might keep telling oneself 'I am stream-enterer, no matter what they say!').

In some cases, false claims made in thought were assigned a *dukkaṭa* by the Buddha. See the [Vinītavatthu, case-studies under Pr 4:](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4/en/brahmali) one bhikkhu rebuked by another bhikkhu who could read minds and, another bhikkhu rebuked by a devatā.

> At one time a monk claimed a superhuman quality in private. A devatā rebuked him, saying, “No, Sir, you haven’t got it.” He became anxious … “There’s no offense entailing expulsion, but there’s an offense of wrong conduct (āpatti dukkaṭassa).”

**Intention:** to misrepresent the truth, motivated by an evil desire.

- knowing that it is a lie, aiming to misrepresent the truth
- motivated by an evil desire

'Evil desire' here means that he wishes that others may think of him as such, does not have to include wishing harm to fulfil intention.

**Result:** the understanding of the speaker and the listener.

The bhikkhu must understand that he is making a claim.

The listener doesn't have to understand or recognize the bhikkhu's claim. See also *Pc 1* (lying and deceit), where Result is not a factor.

If the bhikkhu is making a claim in a language which *he knows* that the other person doesn't understand, he is not intending to deceive him. If the bhikkhu *doesn't know* that the other person doesn't understand, he would fulfil intention.

### Suggested states

Lay supporters may address a teacher with exaggerated faith: 'May the venerable arahant explain to me...'.

Supporters may suggest states: 'We would like to invite four sotāpanna monks to start a temple in our town.'

There is no offense in coming, sitting, etc., as long as the intention is just to accept the invitation and not to imply a claim.

### To impress

Special practices (*dhutaṅga*, long periods of meditation, vegetarianism) out of the desire to impress others: *dukkaṭa*.

Blameless reasons, out of the desire to practice are not an offense.

Examples of **offensive non-offenses** which although don't fulfil the factor of Effort for *Pr 4*, are nonetheless motivated by the desire to win the respect or support of others thorough boasting.

Humblebrag:

- 'I am so dumb that before this retreat I didn't understand jhānas.'
- 'I am a really slow learner, but I don't have any doubt that the Buddha is right.'
- 'My meditation is nothing much, but you know, sometime you can see really interesting things...'

Virtue signalling:

- 'I have learnt to bow like this from a real Forest Kruba Ajahn.'
- 'Those monks talk about football. How could they have even basic samādhi?'

### Non-offenses

- mistaken and exaggerated understanding of one's mental states
- not intending to boast, others trying to read a statement as an implied claim

## Pc 8, Telling unordained person about actual attainment

Origin: similar to Pr 4, but with bhikkhus who boasted of true attainments of each other to get more food during a famine.

**Effort:** reporting a true attainment.

**Object:** to an unordained person.

**Intention** is not a factor, including motivations to inspire.

Good conduct between bhikkhus: Ven. Mogallāna waits to relate his vision until in the presence of the Buddha.

### Non-offenses

- to a bhikkhu or bhikkhuni
- display of psychic power is not assigned an offense, but strongly critized by the Buddha (monk and the wooden bowl)
