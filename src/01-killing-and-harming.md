## Pr 3, Killing a human being

![Pr-3](./includes/mindmaps/pr-3.png)

**Origin:** bhikkhus develop aversion to the body and kill themselves or
ask an assassin to kill them.

Recommending euthanasia can be **parajika** if the instruction is
followed.

## Pc 61, Killing an animal

Giving an order fulfils effort. Result is a factor.

Doesn't include animals smaller than visible to the naked eye. Doesn't
include accidents (sweeping).

## Pc 20, Pouring water containing living beings

Knowing they will die from pouring it. It can also include knowingly
adding poisonous substances.

Giving an order fulfils effort.

Result is not a factor. Doesn't include accidents.

Can't water plants if one plans to eat its fruit, but may indicate it
for others.

## Pc 62, Drinking water containing living beings

Knowing they will die from drinking it, even accidentally.

Using water strainers or robe. Determining a corner of the sanghati as a
water-filter.

Result is not a factor.

## Pc 10, Digging soil

**Origin:** relates to the ancient belief that soil is alive, and loses
life when dug up.

**Object:** 'genuine' soil.

*Not* genuine soil:

-   pure or mostly rock, stones, gravel, sand
-   burnt or already dug up soil
-   until rained on for four months
-   dust from wind erosion

**Effort:** Digging, burning, making a hole, or giving command to do it.

Putting tent pegs in the ground is to be confessed.

**Non-offenses:**

-   unknowingly, unthinkingly, unintentionally
-   indicating a general need or task
-   digging a trapped person or animal out

Allowance to indicate a need or general task to a lay person by "wording
it right."

The expression *kappiya-vohƒÅra* ("allowable expression," or "wording it
right") is used where an express command would be an offense, but an
indication of a desire or intent would not.

## Pc 11, Damaging living plants or seeds

<!-- latex
\begin{multicols}{2}
-->

**Origin:** a bhikkhu cuts down a tree where a deva was living. The rule
is formed later, when people complained of the bhikkhus mistreating
one-facultied life.

**Object:** Living plant or seed. Lower plant life (i.e. mold, algae,
fungi) is not included.

**Effort:** cutting, breaking, cooking, or getting others to do it.

**Fruit with seeds:** allowance to make allowable (kappiyam). Fruit can
be kappied in one "heap".

To 'kappi' fruit is about the feelings of the donor, not killing the
fruit or transfering kamma.

Knowingly eating un-kappied seeds is dukkata.

**Non-offenses:**

-   unknowingly, unthinkingly, unintentionally
-   asking a lay person for flowers etc. in general, or indicating a
    general task
-   can cut a trapped person or animal out
-   counter-fire

**Note:** Pc 10 and Pc 11 prevents bhikkhus from engaging in
agriculture, which is probably part of the intended results, although
not their direct origin.
