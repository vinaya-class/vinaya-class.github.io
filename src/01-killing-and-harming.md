## Pr 3, Killing a human being

![Pr-3](./includes/mindmaps/pr-3.png)

**Origin:** bhikkhus develop aversion to the body and kill themselves or ask an assassin to kill them.

Recommending death or euthanasia can be **pārājika** if the instruction is followed. Hinting fulfils effort, such as "death would be better for you".

A human being is regarded as such from the time when the "being to be born" is established in the womb. This is an uncertain time, sometime after conception during embryo development. The embryo can't develop otherwise.

There is a distinction between recommending an action something which *causes death in each case* (abortion or active contraception) and something which *causes death in some of the cases* (a treatment which can go wrong). There is **no offense** in the second case, e.g. some people are known to die in car accidents, but it doesn't mean that a bhikkhu can't ask a person to drive.

Turning off life-support equipment: if the ill person stated their position on it beforehand, the doctors may be simply following his instruction.

Giving permission to the doctor to turn off the equipment is still not pārājika (not cutting off life, it ends on its own), although one might live with a doubtful heart afterward.

> "If, after descending into the womb, consciousness were to depart, would name-and-form be produced for this world?" "No, lord."
> 
> "If the consciousness of the young boy or girl were to be cut off, would name-and-form ripen, grow, and reach maturity?" "No, lord." ([DN 15](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.15.0.than.html))

## Pc 61, Killing an animal

Giving an order fulfils effort.

**Result** is a factor.

Doesn't include animals smaller than visible to the naked eye. Doesn't include accidents (sweeping). No room for "phrasing it right".

Origin: Ven. Udāyin is killing crows by shooting them with arrows, cutting their heads off and putting them in a row on a stake. The Buddha scolds him, "How can you, foolish man, intentionally deprive a living thing of life? ..." ([Vibh. Pc 61](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc61/en/horner))

Mercy killing by the owner, or euthanasia practices by vets fulfil effort. Having a pet means responsibility.

Acting in doubt, going ahead anyway is dukkaṭa. Such as when the bhikkhu thinks that cleaning an item may or may not kill living beings. Trying carefully not to kill insects while cleaning is not an offense.

**Perception** is a factor. Stepping on a twig with the intention to crush a snake is dukkaṭa.

## Pc 20, Pouring water containing living beings

Knowing they will die from pouring it. It can also include knowingly adding poisonous substances.

If the water doesn't contain living beings, but the bhikkhu thinks it does, pouring or using it is dukkaṭa.

Giving an order fulfils effort.

Result is not a factor. Doesn't include accidents.

Can't water plants if one plans to eat its fruit, but may indicate it for others.

Kutis may use water moats around the stilts to keep out ants. One may treat the water with household chemicals to prevent larvae (e.g. mosquitoes) getting established in the water.

## Pc 62, Using water containing living beings

<!-- latex

-->

Knowing they will die from using or drinking it, even accidentally.

Using water strainers or robe. Determining a corner of the saṅghāṭi as a water-filter.

Result is not a factor.

## Pc 10, Digging soil

<!-- latex
\begin{multicols}{2}
-->

**Origin:** relates to the ancient belief that soil is alive, and loses life when dug up.

**Object:** 'genuine' soil.

*Not* genuine soil:

- dust from wind erosion
- pure or mostly rock, stones, gravel, sand are never 'genuine' soil
- burnt or already dup up soil is not 'genuine' until rained on for four months

If someone digs up the soil, a bhikkhu may shovel it into a wheelbarrow without offense.

**Effort:** Digging, burning, making a hole, or giving command to do it.

Putting tent pegs in the ground is to be confessed.

<!-- latex
\columnbreak
-->

**Non-offenses:**

- unknowingly, unthinkingly, unintentionally
- indicating a general need or task
- asking for clay or or soil
- digging a trapped person or animal out

Allowance to indicate a need or general task to a lay person by 'wording it right' (*kappiya-vohāra*, allowable expression, or 'wording it right').

A specific command would be an offense ("dig a hole here"), but an indication ("dig a hole") of a desire or intent would not ("it would be good to have a hole for this post").

<!-- latex
\end{multicols}
-->

## Pc 11, Damaging living plants or seeds

<!-- latex
\begin{multicols}{2}
-->

**Origin:** a bhikkhu cuts down a tree where a deva was living. The rule is formed later, when people complained of the bhikkhus mistreating one-facultied life.

**Object:** Living plant or seed. Lower plant life (i.e. mold, algae, fungi) is not included.

**Effort:** cutting, breaking, cooking, or getting others to do it.

**Fruit with seeds:** allowance to make allowable (kappiyam). Fruit can be kappied in one 'heap'.

<!-- latex
\columnbreak
-->

To 'kappi' fruit is about the feelings of the donor, not killing the fruit or transfering kamma.

Knowingly eating un-kappied seeds is dukkaṭa.

**Non-offenses:**

- unknowingly, unthinkingly, unintentionally
- asking a lay person for flowers etc. in general, or indicating a general task
- removing branches or leaves which are already dead
- can cut a trapped person or animal out
- counter-fire

**Note:** Pc 10 and Pc 11 prevents bhikkhus from engaging in agriculture, which is probably part of the intended results, although not their direct origin.

Violence even 'for the good cause' has an unpredictable outcome, and lasting
peace has to rely on trust. He avoids making a clear statement about killing
human beings.
