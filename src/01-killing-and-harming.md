## Pr 3, Killing a human being

![Pr-3](./includes/mindmaps/pr-3.png)

**Origin:** bhikkhus develop aversion to the body and kill themselves or
ask an assassin to kill them.

Recommending death or euthanasia can be **parajika** if the instruction is
followed. Hinting fulfils effort, such as "death would be better for you".

A human being is regarded as such from the time when the 'being to be born' is
established in the womb. This is an uncertain time, sometime after conception
during embryo development. The embryo can't develop otherwise.

## Pc 61, Killing an animal

Giving an order fulfils effort.

**Result** is a factor.

Doesn't include animals smaller than visible to the naked eye. Doesn't
include accidents (sweeping). No room for 'phrasing it right'.

Origin: Ven. Udayin is killing crows by shooting them with arrows, cutting their
heads off and putting them in a row on a stake. The Buddha scolds him, "How can
you, foolish man, intentionally deprive a living thing of life? ..." ([Vibh. Pc
61](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc61/en/horner))

Mercy killing by the owner, or euthanasia practices by vets fulfil effort.
Having a pet means responsibility.

Acting in doubt, going ahead anyway is dukkata. Such as when the bhikkhu thinks
that cleaning an item may or may not kill living beings. Trying carefully not to
kill insects while cleaning is not an offence.

**Perception** is a factor. Stepping on a twig with the intention to crush a
snake is dukkata.

## Pc 20, Pouring water containing living beings

Knowing they will die from pouring it. It can also include knowingly
adding poisonous substances.

If the water doesn't contain living beings, but the bhikkhu thinks it does,
pouring or using it is dukkata.

Giving an order fulfils effort.

Result is not a factor. Doesn't include accidents.

Can't water plants if one plans to eat its fruit, but may indicate it
for others.

Kutis may use small gutters as water moats around the stilts to keep out ants.
One has to treat the water with household chemicals, otherwise mosquitoes will
breed in the water.

## Pc 62, Drinking water containing living beings

<!-- latex
\enlargethispage{\baselineskip}
-->

Knowing they will die from drinking it, even accidentally.

Using water strainers or robe. Determining a corner of the sanghati as a
water-filter.

Result is not a factor.

## Pc 10, Digging soil

<!-- latex
\begin{multicols}{2}
-->

**Origin:** relates to the ancient belief that soil is alive, and loses
life when dug up.

**Object:** 'genuine' soil.

*Not* genuine soil:

- dust from wind erosion
- pure or mostly rock, stones, gravel, sand are never 'genuine' soil
- burnt or already dup up soil is not 'genuine' until rained on for four months

If someone digs up the soil, a bhikkhu may shovel it into a wheelbarrow without
offence.

**Effort:** Digging, burning, making a hole, or giving command to do it.

Putting tent pegs in the ground is to be confessed.

<!-- latex
\columnbreak
-->

**Non-offenses:**

- unknowingly, unthinkingly, unintentionally
- indicating a general need or task
- asking for clay or or soil
- digging a trapped person or animal out

Allowance to indicate a need or general task to a lay person by "wording it
right (*kappiya-vohƒÅra*, "allowable expression," or "wording it right").

A specific command would be an offense ('dig a hole here'), but an indication
('dig a hole') of a desire or intent would not ('it would be good to have a hole
for this post').

## Pc 11, Damaging living plants or seeds

<!-- latex
\begin{multicols}{2}
-->

**Origin:** a bhikkhu cuts down a tree where a deva was living. The rule
is formed later, when people complained of the bhikkhus mistreating
one-facultied life.

**Object:** Living plant or seed. Lower plant life (i.e. mold, algae,
fungi) is not included.

**Effort:** cutting, breaking, cooking, or getting others to do it.

**Fruit with seeds:** allowance to make allowable (kappiyam). Fruit can
be kappied in one "heap".

<!-- latex
\columnbreak
-->

To 'kappi' fruit is about the feelings of the donor, not killing the
fruit or transfering kamma.

Knowingly eating un-kappied seeds is dukkata.

**Non-offenses:**

- unknowingly, unthinkingly, unintentionally
- asking a lay person for flowers etc. in general, or indicating a general task
- removing branches or leaves which are already dead
- can cut a trapped person or animal out
- counter-fire

**Note:** Pc 10 and Pc 11 prevents bhikkhus from engaging in
agriculture, which is probably part of the intended results, although
not their direct origin.
