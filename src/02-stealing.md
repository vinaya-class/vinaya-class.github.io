## Pr 2, Stealing

See maps *Pr 2* and *Pr 2 -- Effort*.

## NP 25, Snatching back robe

**Object:** a piece of robe-cloth, at least 4x8 fingerbreadth.

**Perception:** one still considers the robe as one's own, otherwise it
could be *parajika*.

**Intention:** impelled by anger or displeasure. Taking it on trust is
not an offense.

**Effort:** snatching back or having someone to snatch it back.

Dukkata for:

-   giving the command
-   other than cloth
-   snatching from a *non-bhikkhu*
-   hinting with anger

**Non-offenses:**

-   recipient returns the robe on his own accord
-   donor takes it back on trust
-   hinting without anger

## Pc 59, Using cloth or bowl under shared ownership

*Vikappana* is an arrangement whereby a bhikkhu places robe or cloth
under shared ownership so that it may be stored for any length of time.

If the bhikkhu simply gives the robe back to the stores, he has given up
ownership of it and another bhikkhu would be free to take it.

*Vikkappana* allows a bhikkhu to determine a smaller sanghati while
travelling, but not entirely giving up his regular sanghati.

**Object:** robe-cloth, min. 4x8 fingerbreadths, that one has placed
under shared ownership.

**Perception** of ownership is not a factor.

**Effort:** using the cloth without the ownership being rescinded.

**Non-offenses:**

-   rescinded ownership
-   using it on trust (shared with friends)
