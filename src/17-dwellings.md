## Sg 6, Too large hut without sponsor or approval

*Origin:* Some bhikkhus, not having a sponsor, keep harassing the lay people
with requests about building materials for their own huts, and the people begin
to avoid them.

Dwellings are *garubhaṇḍa* articles. In general, they may belong to either the community or
to an individual bhikkhu. When given to the community, the ownership of the
dwelling may *not* be transferred to a bhikkhu.

For a community, whose members may change over time, it is better when the
dwelling belongs to the community, even if an individual bhikkhu has built it
himself. The dwellings can be assigned as needed, and the community can oversee the
proper handling of building projects.

**A hut:** Here, a more permanent structure (such as one with plastered walls
and roof). This rule doesn't apply to makeshift huts with grass roofs.

Assuming the *sugata span* to be 25cm, the maximum size of the hut is about 3m
long on the outside of the wall, and 1.75m wide on the inside of wall. This
relates to the living area, not including an outside porch for example. The
description leaves the thickness of the wall unspecified, but _Pc 19_ limits the
layers of plastering to three.

If a bhikkhu is planning to build such a hut by procuring the materials for it,
he must (1) choose a site and arrange it to be cleared (not breaking *Pc 10* and
*Pc 11*), (2) ask the community to inspect and approve the site.

The site must be:

- free of disturbances (termites, rats, elephants, bears, etc.)
- not near busy locations (crop fields, theme parks, horse stables, etc.)
- enough free land around the hut for a man carrying a ladder to walk around it

The trees don't have to be cut down, but this prevents the hut to be build right
against someone else's property.

A bhikkhu may ask for people to give him help, either through labor or
materials, but careful arrangements should be made. The people should be
reimbursed if they didn't donate the effort or materials.

The bhikkhu may not ask for expensive materials directly, but may indicate what
his project is, and if people offer the materials, he may accept it.

It is not an offense to build a hut for another's use.

## Sg 7, Large hut without approval

Same terms as in *Sg 6*, but the bhikkhu in this case has a dedicated sponsor
who provides the building materials.

## Pc 14, Leaving bed or bench

When a bhikkhu takes community furniture or tools out to the open (either for
doing work or for cleaning), he should put them away before departing for another
business, or have someone put them away to a covered place where they will not
be damaged by rain, or animals. Dogs might carry them off or birds might leave
droppings on them.

The purpose of the rule is to train the bhikkhus' sense of responsibility for
community items.

*Departing* is defined as going farther than ~18 meters from them, described as
one _leḍḍupāta_, 'a stone's throw'.

Leaving tools outside are a _dukkaṭa_ as a derived offense.

The rule doesn't apply to outdoors furniture such as weather-proof benches.

### Non-offenses

- leaving them out to dry, while deciding to come back and put them away
- when there are 'constraints' on them such as tigers lying down on them
- if there are physical dangers, or dangers to one's celibate life

## Pc 15, Spread bedding

When a bhikkhu has taken bedding items from the stores for use, such as when
settling in a room after arriving, he is responsible for cleaning and putting
them back before departing.

The purpose of the rule is to prevent bedding left in an empty hut, where mould,
ants, etc. might damage them.

One should tidy up one's room or hut before leaving a monastery, in a way that
it is ready for another bhikkhu to use.

There is no offense if someone else (such as the guest monk) has already set out
the bedding without one having asked for them. In that case, the guest monks is
responsible for putting the items back.

## Pc 16, Intruding on bhikkhu's sleeping place

A bhikkhu shouldn't knowingly intrude on another bhikkhu's dwelling space, with
the intention to forcing him out.

*To intrude* is defined as lying or sitting down within 75cm of his sleeping
place, or on the way to the entrance.

There is no offense in intruding for a compelling reason, such as suffering from
the cold or heat, being sick, or begin in danger. One should leave after the
reason to intrude has passed.

## Pc 17, Causing a bhikkhu to be evicted

*Origin:* some group-of-six bhikkhus were fixing up a dwelling where they wanted
to spend the Vassa. Some group-of-seventeen bhikkhus waited for them to fix it
up, then drove them out, forcibly taking over the dwelling.

The offense relates to acting out of anger as a primary impulse. Frustrated
greed also produces anger (not getting the hut one wished for).

There is no offense if one's primary motivation is not anger. For example, the
guest monk might have to evict a bhikkhu who is holding onto a dwelling after
being told to leave. There may be anger, but it is not the primary impulse.

A bhikkhu may evict one's student if he is not properly observing his duties.

## Pc 18, Bed on an unplanked loft

A dwelling might have an unplanked loft area for storing the bed or other items.

One should not use a bed which has detachable legs in the loft. The legs might
fall off and hurt someone living in the area below.

## Pc 19, Supervising the building work

*Origin:* Ven. Channa is unsatisfied with the plastering being done on the roof
and walls of his hut. He keeps instructing the builders to put on more layers,
until the hut caves in.

The purpose of the rule is to prevent abusing the generosity of the sponsors and
ruining a building project with insatiable requirements. It relates to *Sg 7*,
when one's hut is sponsored, and one should oversee that the work is done
properly.

## Pc 87, Tall bed or bench

When making a new bed or bench or having it made, its legs should be at most
eight finger-breadths long, from the lower edge of the frame to the floor.
The long legs should be cut back to size.

The purpose is to prevent making imposing furnishings.

## Pc 88, Cotton stuffing

If a bhikkhu orders a bed or bench upholstered with cotton down, the upholstery
should be torn off.

Cotton down used to be a luxury material. It is allowed for certain items, such
as pillows, which should be no larger than the size of the head.

The purpose is to avoid ostentatious, grand and luxurious materials for
furnishings which are not in line with the restrained life style of a mendicant
monastic.
