## NP 21, Keeping extra bowl

**Object:** A suitable alms-bowl.

Five factors of an allowable bowl: proper material, size, fully paid for, fired, not damaged beyond repair.

Allowed materials: clay, iron. Stainless steel by extension.

Forbidden materials: wood, gold, silver, pearl, beryl, crystal, bronze, glass, tin, lead, copper. Aluminium by extension.

Proper size: Smaller than a human skull is too small. Medium size is ~22.5 cm diameter.

**Effort:** When the new bowl reaches one's hands, one may only keep it as 'extra' for 10 days.

One must either determine it for use, place it under shared ownership (*vikappana*), abandon it or give it away.

The offense occurs on the 10th dawnrise after receving it.

**Perception** is not a factor.

There is no offense if the bowl is lost, destroyed or stolen before the 10 days are up.

Using an undetermined bowl is a *dukkaṭa* offense.

## NP 22, Asking for new bowl

*Origin:* a potter offers to make bowls for the bhikkhus. Some of them abuse the
offer without moderation, and the potter no longer has time for his business
work.

A bowl should be repaired as long as possible.

The offense is *dukkaṭa* when asking, a *nissaggiya pācittiya* when receiving it.

'Asking' refers to asking from lay supporters. One may ask the Sangha for a new
bowl from the stores, and the community will decide whether the request is
justified.

*Note:* describe the forfeiture and bowl exchange procedure.

### Non-offenses

Asking from

- a relative
- if one was invited to ask
- a new bowl with one's own resources
- asking for the sake of another from relatives or through invitation

## Pc 60, Hiding another's requisites

**Object:** bowl, robe, sitting cloth, needle box, or belt.

Hiding other requisites is a *dukkaṭa* offense.

Hiding the requisites of a samanera or anagarika is a *dukkaṭa* offense.

**Perception** of whose requisite it is, is not a mitigating factor.

A 'friendly game' fulfils **Intention** all the same.

### Non-offenses

- putting away items to their proper place
- putting it away as a teaching lesson, with the intention to give it back after
  an admonition about not leaving requisites scattered around

## Pc 86, Needle box

*Origin:* similar to NP 22, but with an ivory-worker. Remember to not
over-burden lay supporters by requesting items which are difficult to make or
obtain.

Forbidden materials: bone, ivory, horn.

Allowed materials for a *needle box* are not explicit, but a *needle tube* is
allowed of reed, bamboo, wood, lac (resin), fruit shells, copper, conch-shell.

Receiving and using the improper item when it was requested by oneself (e.g.
given as a surprise gift) is a *dukkaṭa* offense.

The intention of the rule was (a) to stop the fashionable fad, and (b) to not be
burdensome for lay people who offered their help.

The materials themselves are not banned, a number of other items are allowed to
be made of bone, ivory or horn.

A bhikkhu should be aware of the civil law regarding the materials, such as a
ban on ivory trade, or the border regulations on horn (and plant) materials in
New Zealand.

In some countries bhikkhus commonly use robe-tags, buttons, etc. made of bone or
horn.
