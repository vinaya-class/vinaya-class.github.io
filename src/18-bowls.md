## NP 21, Keeping extra bowl

**Object:** A suitable alms-bowl.

Allowed materials: clay, iron. Stainless steel by extension.

Forbidden materials: wood, gold, silver, pearl, beryl, crystal, bronze, glass, tin, lead, copper. Aluminium by extension.

Proper size: Smaller than a human skull is too small. Medium size is ~22.5 cm diameter.

**Effort:** When the new bowl reaches one's hands, one may only keep it as 'extra' for 10 days.

One must either determine it for use, place it under shared ownership (*vikappana*), abandon it or give it away.

The offence occurs on the 10th dawnrise after receving it.

**Perception** is not a factor.

There is no offence if the bowl is lost, destroyed or stolen before the 10 days are up.

## NP 22, Asking for new bowl

*Origin:* a potter offers to make bowls for the bhikkhus. Some of them abuse the
offer without moderation, and the potter no longer has time for his business
work.

A bowl should be repair as long as possible.

The offence is *dukkaṭa* when asking, a *nissaggiya pācittiya* when receiving it.

'Asking' refers to asking from lay supporters. One may ask the Sangha for a new
bowl from the stores, and the community will decide whether the request is
justified.

*Note:* describe the forfeiture and bowl exchange procedure.

### Non-offences

Asking from

- a relative
- if one was invited to ask
- a new bowl with one's own resources
- asking for the sake of another from relatives or through invitation

## Pc 60, Hiding another's requisites

**Object:** bowl, robe, sitting cloth, needle box, or belt.

Hiding other requisites is a *dukkaṭa* offence.

Hiding the requisites of a samanera or anagarika is a *dukkaṭa* offence.

**Perception** of whose requisite it is, is not a mitigating factor.

A 'friendly game' fulfils **Intention** all the same.

### Non-offences

- putting away items to their proper place
- putting it away as a teaching lesson, with the intention to give it back after
  an admonition about not leaving requisites scattered around

## Pc 86, Needle box

*Origin:* similar to NP 22, but with an ivory-worker. Remember to not
over-burden lay supporters by requesting items which are difficult to make or
obtain.

Forbidden materials: bone, ivory, horn.

Allowed materials for a *needle box* are not explicit, but a *needle tube* is
allowed of reed, bamboo, wood, lac (resin), fruit shells, copper, conch-shell.

Receiving and using the improper item when it was requested by oneself (e.g.
given as a surprise gift) is a *dukkaṭa* offence.

The intention of the rule was to stop the fashionable fad, but the materials are
not banned for any type of items.

A number of other items are allowed to be made of bone, ivory or horn.
