## Class Rules

**NOTE:** This is one way to organize the class routine, please adapt as you see
best. One example alternative would be that after presenting the rules, a large
group can be broken up to several smaller ones for the quiz questions and
subsequent discussion, with each sub-group including at least one experienced
/thera/.

## Questions

**NOTE:** The questions are written to _lean toward_ a particular answer, but
they may have different solutions depending on how one imagined the situation
presented. They are intended to be filled out and reviewed together during the
class, discussing the possible solutions.
