-   as a man with his head cut off cannot become one to live again
-   as a withered leaf separated from its stem cannot be joined again
-   as a flat stone that has been broken in half cannot be put together
    again
-   as a palmyra tree cut off at the crown is incapable of further
    growth.

### Probation and Penance

One doesn't have to wait until one is certain about the offence, speaking to
another bhikkhu about a doubtful situation will at least clear one's conscience
that one is not concealing it.

A bhikkhu who comitted a sanghadisesa must inform another bhikkhu as
soon as possible, but at most until the next dawnrise. The Sangha must
meet and at his request, allow a six-dawn period of penance (*mānatta*).
If he concealed the offence, a probation period (*parivāsa*) is required
beforehand.

The Sangha will determine when and where the bhikkhu should observe the
*parivāsa* and *mānatta*. These periods are determined by the Sangha and don't
have to occur back-to-back.

After completing *mānatta* he can only be rehabilitated as a bhikkhu in regular
standing by a community meeting of at least 20 bhikkhus. He is not required to
stay at that particular monaster after having received rehabilitation.

If he commits another sanghadisesa before rehabilitation, he must inform a
bhikkhu and ask a Sangha of at least four to 'send him back to the beginning.'

Characteristic duties during penance:

- not receiving duties of respect from other bhikkhus
- inform visiting bhikkhus that he is undergoing penance
- every day, notify every bhikkhu in the monastery of his offence
- stay under a separate roof than the other bhikkhus
- only leave the monastery when accompanied by four other bhikkhus

The duties during probation are the same as during penance, except:

- inform the Sangha of his offence every fortnight, not every day
- only leave the monastery when accompanied by a single other bhikkhu

### Sensual thoughts

Sensual thoughts are not designated an offence, but they grow quickly and lead
to one's downfall.

When reconizing that one has been caught up in a sensual fantasy, immediately
visualizing *asubha* of the body can break up the lustful mental state.

Repeatedly training to notice the signs of *asubha* changes the unconscious
habits of the dreaming mind as well.
