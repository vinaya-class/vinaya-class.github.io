## NP 16, Carrying Wool

One may carry the unmade wool for three yojanas (`3*16 = 48 km`). Further than
that, one should find someone else to transport the wool for him.

If people see a bhikkhu carrying raw materials, they might assume that he bought them,
and that he is producing something to sell.

## NP 26, Thread

Asking for thread and having it woven into a robe is improper protocol for a
bhikkhu.

A bhikkhu should request from his supporters what he needs, rather than the raw
materials for it.

### Non-offences

- if both the supporters and weavers are his relatives
- if they made invitation to ask
- asking for the sake of another
- by means of one's own resources

## NP 27, Weavers

When his supporters are organizing requisites for a bhikkhu, such as having a
robe woven for him, he should accept what he receives. If the supporters ask for
details, he should describe what he needs to them, instead of interfering with
how they obtain it.

Origin: Ven. Upananda interferes in the process of a robe being made for him by
going to the weaver's shop and making a fuss about details.

Related to *NP 8*, making stipulations about what kind of robe to receive.

### Non-offences

- the supporters are relatives
- they have invited one to ask
- asking for the sake of another
- getting the weavers make the cloth less expensive
- by means of one's own resources (e.g. the bhikkhu hired the weavers)

## NP 11-15, Summary of santhatas

A *santhata* is a blanket or rug made of felt material. It is made by strewing
the threads over a surface, adding glue, and using a roller to flatten it.

They seem to have been used as a rug for sitting or lying down, or a warm
blanket for cold weather.

Although this type of material not commonly used today, the rules indicate the
proper attitude when obtaining one's requisites, such as warm jackets, personal
blankets, carry bags, suitcases, back packs and so on.

**NP 11:** (Unnecessarily expensive) Forbids using silk threads in the material,
an unnecessarily expensive component. After obtaining such a santhata, the
procedure for forfeiture, confession, and receiving the item back is the same.

**NP 12:** (Flashy and stylish) Forbids using pure black wool for the material.
This seemed to have been a stylish extravagance.

**NP 13:** (Using up the less high-quality materials) When having a new santhata
made, it should contain a mixture of threads: two parts black, third of white,
fourth of brown. The crucial aspect being the mixture not containing more than
one-half of black wool.

**NP 14:** (Making it last a long time) A new santhata should last at least six
years. If necessary to obtain another sooner, one may seek the authorization
from the community.

**NP 15:** (Re-using the old materials and discolouring the new) When making a
new santhata, a 25cm wide strip of old felt material should be incorporated on
each side.
