The ten reasons for the establishing of the Pāṭimokkha:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  "For the excellence of the Sangha;
\item
  for the wellbeing of the Sangha;
\item
  for the control of ill-controlled bhikkhus;
\item
  for the comfort of wellbehaved bhikkhus;
\item
  for the restraint of the \emph{āsavā} in this present state;
\item
  for protection against the \emph{āsavā} in a future state;
\item
  to give confidence to those of little faith;
\item
  to increase the confidence of the faithful;
\item
  to establish the True Dhamma;
\item
  to support the Vinaya."
\end{enumerate}

Four things not to be done, \emph{akaraṇīya}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  sexual intercourse: as a man with his head cut off cannot live
\item
  theft: as a withered leaf separated from its stalk cannot become green
  again
\item
  depriving a human being of life: as a flat stone, broken in half,
  cannot be put together again
\item
  claiming false attainments: as a palm tree, cut off at the crown, is
  incapable of further growth
\end{enumerate}
