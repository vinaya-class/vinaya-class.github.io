\section{NP 1, Keeping robe cloth for more than 10 days}

Encouraging modesty to avoid hoarding requisites.

\textbf{Object:} a piece of cloth which \emph{could} be used for making
part of a robe, at least 4 x 8 inches.

It has to be a suitable material for \emph{bhikkhus}. Leather is
unsuitable. Black, blue, crimson are not suitable colours for a robe.

\textbf{Effort:} keeping it for more than ten days without determining
it for use.

\textbf{Perception} is not a factor, mis-counting the days is not an
excuse.

If the robe develops a hole, it loses its determination. It has to be
mended within 10 days, and determined for use again.

Holes which are small, or located within a hand-span along the edge
don't cause the determination to lapse, but when mended, may require the
robe to be re-determined.

\textbf{Robe-season:} 4th lunar month of \emph{Vassana}, from the full
moon in October. During that time one may receive and keep robe-cloth
for more than ten days.

\section{NP 2, Separated from robe}

\textbf{Object:} either one of the bhikkhu's \emph{currently determined}
three main robes, the \emph{antaravāsaka} (sabong, lower robe),
\emph{uttarāsaṅga} (jiwon, upper robe), and \emph{saṅghāṭi} (outer
robe).

This rule doesn't apply to other cloth requisites, such as a work-sabong
or an old jiwon used as a bedsheet.

\textbf{Effort:} at dawnrise (civil twilight), being outside of `the
same area' than where one's robes are located.

`\emph{The same area}' may be within \emph{hatthapasa} (arm's reach), in
the same room, building, or the monastery grounds, depending on the
local \emph{kor-wat}.

Exception during the robe-season, if one is eligible for \emph{kathina}
privileges, and unless one has relinquished those privileges.

\section{NP 3, Out of season robe cloth}

Extra robe-cloth may be kept for up to 30 days, when it is not enough
for a robe, and one is expecting to receive more cloth later.

\section{NP 6, Asking for robe cloth}

Asking a lay supporter who is not a relative, for robe-cloth, except
when one's robes have been stolen or destroyed.

A bhikkhu who arrives at a monastery with no cloth to cover himself may
take any cloth he finds to wear, if he intends to return it when he
obtains a proper robe.

\section{NP 7, Excess robe cloth}

When one's robes have been stolen or destroyed, one may ask for cloth at
most the amount enough for an upper- and lower robe.

There is no offence for accepting cloth when the donors are offering it
for a different reason.

\section{NP 8, Request to improve robe}

An unrelated householder wishes to purchase robes for the bhikkhu, and
he suggests purchasing a more expensive one.

No offence when the lay person is a relative, or has invited one to ask
for cloth.

\section{NP 9, Request to combine robe funds}

As NP 8, but in this case two householders are offering to sponsor
individual pieces of robe, and the bhikkhu suggests them to purchase a
more expensive robe by combining their funds.
