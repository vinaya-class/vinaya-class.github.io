\section{Pr 4, Lying about superior attainments}

Extreme case of lying (Pc 1).

Origin: During a period of drought and famine, certain bhikkhus praised
each other's false attainments to the lay people so that they may have a
comfortable Vassa.

\begin{quote}
How can you for the sake of your stomachs praise one another's
superhuman qualities to lay people? It would be better for your bellies
to be cut open with a sharp butcher's knife than for you to praise one
another's superhuman qualities to lay people.

Why is that? Because for that reason you might die or experience
death-like suffering, but you wouldn't because of that be reborn in a
bad destination. But for \emph{this} reason you might.

Five great gangsters as bad monks:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  wanting to be honoured, revered and obtain gifts
\item
  learning the Buddha's teachings and taking it as his own
\item
  accusing a pure practitioner of the holy life of sexual intercourse
\item
  taking and using Sangha property to create a following among lay
  people
\item
  `But in this world this is the greatest gangster: he who untruthfully
  and groundlessly boasts about a superhuman quality. Why is that?
  Monks, you've eaten the country's almsfood by theft.'
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Object:} superior human states which are not accessible to
mundane, ordinary people (\emph{puthujjana}). States are categorized in
three groups.

\emph{Mahaggata dhamma}, `expanded states'. Some are supra-mundane if
they depend on higher jhānas.

Terms: \emph{jhāna} (absorption), \emph{samāpatti} (attainments),
\emph{vipassana} (insight), \emph{samatha} (tranquillity).
\emph{Jhāyati} (verb) in the Canon has simple meaning: (1) thinks about
(2) meditates; contemplates.

One may avoid confusion about terms by describing the five factors of
\emph{jhāna}, rather than using the term on its own.

\emph{Lokuttara dhamma}, `transcendent states'. Always supra-mundane.
Related to the eradication of the mental fetters. Nine: Nibbāna plus the
four paths and their four fruitions.

\emph{Tiracchāna-vijjā}, `animal knowledge'. Always mundane. Examples
are occult abilities, future-telling, giving protective charms, casting
malevolent spells, psychic healing, practicing as a medium, etc.

\textbf{Perception:} knowing as non-existent, not present in oneself. If
it is a mistaken claim out of overestimation, that would not be
parajika.

\emph{Non-existent} defined as `not to be found; not knowing, not seeing
a skillful state within oneself, (yet saying,) ``There is a skillful
state within me.''\,'

\textbf{Effort:} Addressing a human being. Speaking about the state
present within oneself, or one being in the state. Talking to oneself
about it is a \emph{dukkaṭa} offense.

Explicit:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  `I have attained the first jhāna'
\item
  `I have seen the heavenly realms'
\item
  `I know my previous lifetimes'
\end{itemize}

Implicit or idiomatic:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  `I delight in an empty dwelling' (referring to jhāna)
\item
  `I have no doubts about the Buddha's teaching' (referring to stream
  entry)
\end{itemize}

Humblebrag:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  `I am so dumb that before this retreat I didn't understand jhānas.'
\item
  `I am a really slow learner, but I don't have any doubt that the
  Buddha is right.'
\item
  `My meditation is nothing much, but you know, sometime you can see
  really interesting things\ldots{}'
\end{itemize}

Virtue signalling:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  `I have learnt to bow like this from a real Forest Kruba Ajahn.'
\item
  `Those monks talk about football. How could they have even basic
  samādhi?'
\end{itemize}

\clearpage

Gestures by agreement:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  `The first who leaves their kuti is an arahant.'
\end{itemize}

False claims made \emph{in thought} are assigned a \emph{dukkaṭa} by the
Buddha. (Story: seen by a bhikkhu who could read minds and a devata.)

\textbf{Intention:} to misrepresent the truth, motivated by an evil
desire.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  knowing that it is a lie, aiming to misrepresent the truth
\item
  motivated by an evil desire
\end{itemize}

`Evil desire' here means that he wishes that others may think of him as
such, does not have to include wishing harm to fulfil intention.

\textbf{Result:} the understanding of the speaker and the listener.

The bhikkhu must understand that he is making a claim.

The listener doesn't have to understand or recognize the bhikkhu's
claim. See also \emph{Pc 1} (lying and deceit), where Result is not a
factor.

If the bhikkhu is making a claim in a language which \emph{he knows}
that the other person doesn't understand, he is not intending to deceive
him. If the bhikkhu \emph{doesn't know} that the other person doesn't
understand, he would fulfil intention.

\subsection{Suggested states}

Lay supporters may address a teacher with exaggerated faith: `May the
venerable arahant explain to me\ldots{}'.

Supporters may suggest states: `We would like to invite four sotāpanna
monks to start a temple in our town.'

There is no offense in coming, sitting, etc., as long as the intention
is just to accept the invitation and not to imply a claim.

\subsection{To impress}

Special practices (dhutaṅga, long periods of meditation, vegetarianism)
out of the desire to impress others: dukkaṭa. Blameless reasons out of
desire to practice are not an offense.

\subsection{Non-offenses}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  mistaken and exaggerated understanding of one's mental states
\item
  not intending to boast, others trying to read a statement as an
  implied claim
\end{itemize}

\clearpage

\section{Pc 8, Telling unordained person about actual attainment}

Origin: similar to Pr 4, but with bhikkhus who boasted of true
attainments of each other to get more food during a famine.

\textbf{Effort:} reporting a true attainment.

\textbf{Object:} to an unordained person.

\textbf{Intention} is not a factor, including motivations to inspire.

Good conduct between bhikkhus: Ven. Mogallāna waits to relate his vision
until in the presence of the Buddha.

\subsection{Non-offenses}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  to a bhikkhu or bhikkhuni
\item
  display of psychic power is not assigned an offense, but strongly
  critized by the Buddha (monk and the wooden bowl)
\end{itemize}
