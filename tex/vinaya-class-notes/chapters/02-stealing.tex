\section{Pr 2, Stealing}

See maps \emph{Pr 2} and \emph{Pr 2 -- Effort}.

\section{NP 25, Snatching back robe}

\textbf{Object:} a piece of robe-cloth, at least 4x8 fingerbreadth.

\textbf{Perception:} one still considers the robe as one's own,
otherwise it could be \emph{parajika}.

\textbf{Intention:} impelled by anger or displeasure. Taking it on trust
is not an offense.

\textbf{Effort:} snatching back or having someone to snatch it back.

Dukkata for:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  giving the command
\item
  other than cloth
\item
  snatching from a \emph{non-bhikkhu}
\item
  hinting with anger
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Non-offenses:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  recipient returns the robe on his own accord
\item
  donor takes it back on trust
\item
  hinting without anger
\end{itemize}

\section{Pc 59, Using cloth or bowl under shared ownership}

\emph{Vikappana} is an arrangement whereby a bhikkhu places robe or
cloth under shared ownership so that it may be stored for any length of
time.

If the bhikkhu simply gives the robe back to the stores, he has given up
ownership of it and another bhikkhu would be free to take it.

\emph{Vikkappana} allows a bhikkhu to determine a smaller sanghati while
travelling, but not entirely giving up his regular sanghati.

\textbf{Object:} robe-cloth, min. 4x8 fingerbreadths, that one has
placed under shared ownership.

\textbf{Perception} of ownership is not a factor.

\textbf{Effort:} using the cloth without the ownership being rescinded.

\textbf{Non-offenses:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  rescinded ownership
\item
  using it on trust (shared with friends)
\end{itemize}
