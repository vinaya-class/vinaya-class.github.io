\section{NP 10, Fund with steward}

The purpose of the rule is to free bhikkhus from the complex
responsibilities of buying and selling, while facilitating the means and
protocols for their support with money.

A bhikkhu is not allowed to accept other funds either, such as jewels,
commodities, land, livestock, etc.

A bhikkhu may designate a lay steward to manage funds offered for the
bhikkhu's support.

If the bhikkhu harasses the steward with impatient prompting, even if he
obtains the requisite, the item must be forfeited and the NP offence
confessed.

If the bhikkhu exceeds the number of allowed promptings, he incurs the
NP offence when obtaining the item.

A verbal prompting may be substituted with two silent ones: from 6
verbal and 0 silent, to 0 verbal and 12 silent.

If the steward fails to use the funds to support the bhikkhu, he should
inform the donors.

When speaking with the steward, the bhikkhu should indicate what he
needs, but may not use commands to tell them, `Give me an X, get an X
for me with the fund'.

Funds for the Sangha or a group follow the same protocols.

Funds set up for one kind of \emph{lahubhaṇḍa} may be used for another
kind, with a decision via \emph{apalokana-kamma}.

Funds set up for \emph{garubhaṇḍa} (lodgings, furniture, etc.) may not
be diverted for \emph{lahubhaṇḍa}, but NP 20 allows the community to
arrange \emph{garubhaṇḍa} to be sold and purchase \emph{lahubhaṇḍa}.

In the case of invitations, follow the four-month period protocol in Pc
47.

There is no exemption for relatives or people who have invited the
bhikkhu to ask.

\textbf{Object:} A fund left with a steward to buy robe cloth, or any
fund for any type of requisite (including construction or book
printing).

\textbf{Steward:} a layperson or entity responsible for handling funds
or transactions on behalf of a bhikkhu or group of bhikkhus.

Three types of stewards:

\enlargethispage*{\baselineskip}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Indicated by the bhikkhu

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The bhikkhu points the person out
  \item
    The donor gives funds to the steward and tells the bhikkhu
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Indicated by the donor or messenger

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The donor or messenger chooses the steward and tells the bhikkhu
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Indicated by neither

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Someone overhears the conversation and volunteers to act as steward
  \item
    The donor gives funds to the steward, but doesn't tell the bhikkhu
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Protocol for accepting funds}

Allowable:

If you are asked who the steward is and you point out a layperson and
say, ``That person is the steward''.

Unallowable:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Accepting money (see NP 18). You should tell the donor that bhikkhus
  don't accept money.
\item
  If a donor asks you who your steward is and you say, ``Give it to
  him'' or ``He will keep it'' (see NP 18).
\item
  If a donor asks you who your steward is and you say, ``He will buy
  it'' or ``He will get it in exchange'' (see NP 20).
\item
  If the donor asks, ``Who should I give this to?'' and you point
  someone out. A wise policy instead is to broach the topic of stewards
  so that the donor asks a question to which you may give an allowable
  answer.
\end{itemize}

\section{NP 18, Gold, silver and money}

A bhikkhu is forbidden to accept gifts of money, getting others to
accept them, or consent to it being placed next to him.

\emph{Perception} is not a mitigating factor.

\emph{Intention} is not a mitigating factor. The bhikkhu may not accept
the money for someone else's sake.

When informing lay supporters who wish to make a donation, the proper
language should be used, i.e.~not giving them instruction what to do
with their money.

If the donor does not intend the money for the bhikkhu (i.e.~offering it
to support the monastery in general), it is not an offence to allow them
to place the money next to the bhikkhu.

If someone drops money into a bhikkhu's bowl against his protest, he may
ask someone to remove it without an offence.

The term `gold or silver' includes the materials, and whatever is used
as currency.

A currency is:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  used for the purpose of general exchange
\item
  have a standardized value
\item
  presentable by any bearer
\end{itemize}

Not a currency:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a money order or check made out to a specific person
\item
  credit- and debit cards
\item
  a store's voucher, gift card, or discount points
\item
  food stamps
\item
  promissory notes
\end{itemize}

Credit cards are not a currency, but are not allowable to use (see NP
20).

There is no offence for a bhikkhu, in the monastery, to pick up gold or
money and put it away for safe keeping.

\section{NP 19, Selling or buying}

This covers the case when a bhikkhu would instruct someone else to
arrange the trade, without himself accepting the money.

There is no allowance for `wording things right'
(\emph{kappiya-vohāra}).

A bhikkhu may not instruct a steward to sell something or invest money
for profit.

\section{NP 20, Trade}

Exchange of items with lay people or members of other sects.

\emph{Origin:} Ven. Upananda exchanges a nicely made robe for a cloak
with a wanderer, who later regrets the trade and wants it back.

Credit cards or checks don't count as currency, but any trade arranged
with them would come under this rule.

\subsection{Non-offences}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  asking for the price
\item
  informing the steward or seller (e.g.~``I have this. I need X'') and
  letting the steward or seller arrange the exchange
\item
  if the other person is a bhikkhus or novice
\item
  saying, ``Give X for Y'' when engaging in trade with your parents
\item
  telling the steward, ``Don't take it'' when you think the steward is
  getting a bad deal
\end{itemize}
