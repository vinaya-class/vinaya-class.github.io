\section{NP 10, Fund with steward}

The purpose of the rule is to free bhikkhus from the complex
responsibilities of buying and selling, while facilitating the means and
protocols for their support with money.

A bhikkhu is not allowed to accept other funds either, such as jewels,
commodities, land, livestock, etc.

A bhikkhu may designate a lay steward to manage funds offered for the
bhikkhu's support.

If the bhikkhu harasses the steward with impatient prompting, even if he
obtains the requisite, the item must be forfeited and the NP offence
confessed.

If the bhikkhu exceeds the number of allowed promptings, he incurs the
NP offence when obtaining the item.

A verbal prompting may be substituted with two silent ones: from 6
verbal and 0 silent, to 0 verbal and 12 silent.

If the steward fails to use the funds to support the bhikkhu, he should
inform the donors.

When speaking with the steward, the bhikkhu should indicate what he
needs, but may not use commands to tell them, `Give me an X, get an X
for me with the fund'.

Funds for the Sangha or a group follow the same protocols.

Funds set up for one kind of \emph{lahubhaṇḍa} may be used for another
kind, with a decision via \emph{apalokana-kamma}.

Funds set up for \emph{garubhaṇḍa} (lodgings, furniture, etc.) may not
be diverted for \emph{lahubhaṇḍa}, but NP 20 allows the community to
arrange \emph{garubhaṇḍa} to be sold and purchase \emph{lahubhaṇḍa}.

In the case of invitations, follow the four-month period protocol in Pc
47.

There is no exemption for relatives or people who have invited the
bhikkhu to ask.

\section{NP 18, Gold, silver and money}

A bhikkhu is forbidden to accept gifts of money, getting others to
accept them, or consent to it being placed next to him.

\emph{Perception} is not a mitigating factor.

\emph{Intention} is not a mitigating factor. The bhikkhu may not accept
the money for someone else's sake.

When informing lay supporters who wish to make a donation, the proper
language should be used, i.e.~not giving them instruction what to do
with their money.

If the donor does not intend the money for the bhikkhu (i.e.~offering it
to support the monastery in general), it is not an offence to allow them
to place the money next to the bhikkhu.

If someone drops money into a bhikkhu's bowl against his protest, he may
ask someone to remove it without an offence.

The term `gold or silver' includes the materials, and whatever is used
as currency.

A currency is:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  used for the purpose of general exchange
\item
  have a standardized value
\item
  presentable by any bearer
\end{itemize}

Not a currency:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a check made out to a specific person
\item
  a store's voucher
\item
  food stamps
\end{itemize}

There is no offence for a bhikkhu, in the monastery, to pick up gold or
money and put it away for safe keeping.

\section{NP 19, Selling or buying}

This covers the case when a bhikkhu would instruct someone else to
arrange the trade, without himself accepting the money.

There is no allowance for `wording thing right' (\emph{kappiya-vohāra}).

\section{NP 20, Trade}

Exchange of items with lay people or members of other sects.

\emph{Origin:} Ven. Upananda exchanges a nicely made robe for a cloak
with a wanderer, who later regrets the trade and wants it back.

There is no offence for exchanging allowable items between bhikkhus or
novices.
