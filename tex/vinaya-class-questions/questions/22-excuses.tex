\renewcommand*{\theChapterTitle}{22. Excuses}

The abbot tells a bhikkhu to keep his robes with him in his kuti during the
night. The bhikkhu responds that he prefers another definition of the rule, and
keeps his robes in the \emph{dāna-sāla} instead. Is this an offence?

\bigskip

A bhikkhu who is in charge of the monastery office, removes the list of Sangha
regulations from the wall, hoping that the other bhikkhus will forget them. Is
this an offence?

A samanera is in charge of preparing the community breakfast. He always makes
sure to arrange his favourite jam on the samaneras' tray. After he receives
upasampada, during breakfast he sneaks the jam from the samaneras' tray to the
bhikkhus', thinking that if he gets caught, he can always say that he is new to
the rules. Is there an offence?
