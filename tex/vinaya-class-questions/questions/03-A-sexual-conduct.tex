\begin{problem}

  A bhikkhu is staying at the apartment of a lay friend, where they organize a small
  gathering, and they start drinking alcohol. The bhikkhu gets drunk, and
  eventually he goes to bed in his room. He wakes up, and finds a woman's
  underwear in his bed, with a note saying `love and kisses', plus a used
  condom.

  Is the bhikkhu pārājika?

    \bChoices
    \Ans0 No, because he was drunk\eAns
    \Ans0 No, if he was practising tantric freedom and compassion\eAns

    \eChoices
  \end{answers}

  \begin{solution}
    Pārājika if there had been consenting intercourse,
    but the evidence as described is not sufficient
    and could be a deliberate plot for defaming Buddhist monks in general.
  \end{solution}

  \textbf{Discussion:} What if he convinces himself that he is pārājika,
  but later finds out that they had played a prank on him?

  What conditional cases must be considered?

  \begin{solution}
    Cases:\\
    \textbf{(a)} he had formally disrobed to be sure,\\
    \textbf{(b)} he didn't disrobe (assuming his bhikkhu status is nil) but committed pārājika since the incident,\\
    \textbf{(c)} he didn't disrobe and didn't commit pārājika since.
  \end{solution}
