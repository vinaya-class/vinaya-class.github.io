  \begin{solution}
    If the bhikkhu remembers at least as much that he never had intention to kill the other, it would absolve him of the the \emph{pārājika}.

    Can he be considered insane while sleepwalking? Psychosis is described as an acute or chronic mental state marked by loss of contact with reality, disorganized speech and behaviour, and often by hallucinations or delusions.

    Did he act with the intention to kill? A normally self-controlled person, under the effects of drugs or alcohol, can also act aggressively and violently. In most jurisdictions, intoxication is not a defense to a charge of murder, as the law generally holds individuals responsible for their actions even if they were under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time.

    The situation has known legal precedent:

    \href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15260363_Homicidal_Somnambulism_A_Case_Report}{Homicidal Somnambulism: A Case Report (researchgate.net)}

    ``A case of a homicide and an attempted homicide during presumed sleepwalking is reported in which somnambulism was the legal defense and led to an acquittal.''

    The Commentary's definition of being insane exempts bhikkhus under psychosis-inducing drugs, but not common intoxicants.

    ``The Commentary defines as insane anyone who `goes about in an unseemly way, with deranged perceptions, having cast away all sense of shame and compunction, not knowing whether he has transgressed major or minor training rules.'
    A bhikkhu under the influence of a severe psychosis-inducing drug would apparently fall under this exemption, but one under the influence of a more common intoxicant would not.''

\begin{problem}

  An elderly relative of a bhikkhu falls into a comatose state and is taken to the hospital.
  On previous occasions he used to speak against his life being extended by life-support equipment.
  In the hospital, the doctor informs the bhikkhu that there is not much chance of recovery, and asks the bhikkhu whether they should turn off the life-support.
  He replies, `Turn if off. That seems to be what he wanted in such a situation'.
  The doctor turns off the equipment and the person dies shortly thereafter.

  A bhikkhu is sweeping off insects from the porch while lay visitors are standing nearby.

    There is no room for \emph{kappiya-vohāra} in \emph{Pc 61}. Whatever one says in hopes of inciting someone else to kill an animal would fulfil the factor of effort.

    \emph{Pc 61} thus differs from \emph{Pr 3}, under which commanding covers only clear imperatives.

      He might not be aiming to kill it with the first blow, but if the dog doesn't let go, he is probably scared enough to hit it until it dies.

      Dukkaṭa for hitting the animal, if he was so scared that he didn't know he is killing the dog.

      If the non-committed shrug is a form of \emph{kappiya-vohāra} (hoping to encourage the manager to kill the rats), this is not permitted under Pc 61 and the offense is pācittiya.

      No offenses if the bhikkhu was expressing his doubt.
      The community may provide clear instructions for the lay manager on what is and is not a proper course of action for him.

% In a hospital, a bhikkhu who is serving as a chaplain visits a terminally ill patient and tells them that death would be a release from their suffering and that they should consider turning off their life-support equipment. The patient, who is heavily medicated and not in a clear state of mind, agrees to the suggestion. The bhikkhu then goes to the doctor and gives permission for the equipment to be turned off. This would be considered an offense under the rule against intentionally causing the death of a human being, as the bhikkhu actively incited the patient to die and gave permission for the equipment to be turned off.

% The distinction between turning off life-support equipment based on the ill person's stated position and giving permission to the doctor to turn off the equipment lies in the level of involvement of the bhikkhu. If the ill person has previously stated their position on life-support equipment and the doctors are simply following their instructions, then the bhikkhu is not committing an offense. However, if the bhikkhu gives permission to the doctor to turn off the equipment, they are still not committing a pārājika offense, as it is not considered cutting off life, but they may still live with a doubtful heart afterward.
