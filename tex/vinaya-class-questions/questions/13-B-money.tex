\chapter{13.B. Money}
\renewcommand*{\theChapterTitle}{13.B. Money}

% A bhikkhu is handling money while helping to organize a fundraising event for a local charity. They accidentally drop a $10 bill on the ground and pick it up without notifying anyone. In this situation, the bhikkhu does not commit a pārājika offense, but they may have violated a rule related to handling money or taking things that do not belong to them. To determine the specific rule reference code for this situation, one may need to consult the Vinaya, the code of conduct for Buddhist monks.
