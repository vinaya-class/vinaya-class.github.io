    \bigskip

    \begin{solution}
      Result is not a factor.
      Including lustful intention would be \emph{saṅghādisesa}.
      Intention + Effort could be a dukkaṭa if the Object is a man.
    \end{solution}

    \textbf{Discussion:} describe such a situation.

\begin{problem*}

  Are there offences?

  \begin{parts}

  \item
    A bhikkhu is walking behind a woman. She suddenly stops, and the bhikkhu walks
    into her. Annoyed and angered, he starts swearing about her butt.

    \bigskip

    \begin{answers}{5}
      \bChoices
      \Ans0 saṅghādisesa\eAns
      \Ans0 thullacāya\eAns
      \Ans0 pācittiya\eAns
      \Ans1 dukkaṭa\eAns
      \Ans0 no offences\eAns
      \eChoices
    \end{answers}

    \begin{solution}
      Insulting a lay person is dukkaṭa.
      Swearing out of anger is bad behaviour, but not a saṅghādisesa.
    \end{solution}

    \bigskip

    \textbf{Discussion:} What if he swears not in anger, but with a naughty
    smile? What if he swears in a language she doesn't understand, but asks
    other people about it later?

    \begin{solution}
      Lewd swearing is a saṅghādisesa when immediately understood.

      If not understood immediately, thullacāya if using direct expressions, dukkaṭa if using euphemisms.
    \end{solution}

    \bigskip

  \item A bhikkhu meets a female visitor for a cup of tea, the two of them are alone.
  She later complains, saying that the bhikkhu made vulgar jokes,
  and she felt personally offended by them.

    \bigskip

    \begin{answers}{5}
      \bChoices
      \Ans0 saṅghādisesa\eAns
      \Ans0 thullacāya\eAns
      \Ans0 pācittiya\eAns
      \Ans0 dukkaṭa\eAns
      \Ans1 no offences\eAns
      \eChoices
    \end{answers}

    \begin{solution}
      Since she didn't specify what the jokes or their offending aspect has beed,
      one should (1) ask her to describe the precise nature of the jokes,
      (2) ask the bhikkhu to do the same,
      in order to deal with the matter according to the facts.

      There is no offence if we the jokes were using
      rough language, cynical or insensitive, with no lewd intention.

      Joking for the sake of enjoying a sexually improper joke with a woman would be saṅghādisesa.

      Jokes are not usually made out of an impulse of anger, which would be an exception from saṅghādisesa.
    \end{solution}

    \bigskip

  \item A bhikkhu is carrying a table with a woman. He playfully pushes her
    with the table, sharing a good laugh.

    \bigskip

    \begin{answers}{5}
      \bChoices
      \Ans0 saṅghādisesa\eAns
      \Ans1 thullacāya\eAns

      \Ans0 no offences\eAns
      \eChoices
    \end{answers}

    \begin{solution}
      Thullacāya, because of the indirect contact with `objects connected to the body'.
      Minimum level for `lustful intention' is even a momentary enjoyment of the contact.
    \end{solution}

    \bigskip

  \item A bhikkhu injures his arm with a deep cut. In the hospital, a female
    doctor stitches his wound. He can't feel his arm because of the
    anaesthetics. He remains completely still, but enjoys looking at the sweet female doctor.

      \Ans1 no offences\eAns
      \eChoices
    \end{answers}

    \begin{solution}
      No offence as long as he is making no effort.
      If he makes a move with the desire for contact, saṅghādisesa.
      It is irrelevant whether his enjoyment is from the contact or not.

      If he arranges to see the same female doctor again, that will count as effort.
    \end{solution}

    \bigskip

  \item A bhikkhu is trying on shoes in a shop. A female assistant helps to put
    on a shoe and she asks, `Is that comfortable?' He looks into her eye and
