  \begin{solution}
    Dukkaṭa for a broken promise. Make sure to clarify intentions, ask again for
    clear statements if necessary.

    `I give this to you, please give it to X' -- he is given ownership of the
    item, and \emph{promises} to give it to X.

    `This is my friend's recorder, please take it to him' -- he is not given
    ownership, if he keeps it, the penalty is parajika.
  \end{solution}

  He tells the bhikkhu that he may take it anytime when he needs it, and keeps the bowl in his kuti.

    the \emph{vikappana} is automatically rescinded when items are taken on
    trust.
