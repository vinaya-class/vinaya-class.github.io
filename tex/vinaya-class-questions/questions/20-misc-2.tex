      \begin{solution}
        Dukkata as a derived offence of Pc 48 (watching battle).

        Dukkata as not a proper place for a bhikkhu to be, `a wrong resort'.

        Similar situation is walking past the residence of the president, which is guarded by the military.

        A war memorial would be no offence, as it's not dedicated to war, but to those who lost (or gave) their lives in it.

      \item A bhikkhu is visiting a prison inmate on his request for religious
      counselling. There are military vehicles parked in front of the prison
