  has been arranged to take him to Wat Pa Thai Buddhist temple. The car however
  gets into a junction it doesn't know how to handle, and pulls off to the side,
  waiting for a manual driver from Waymo. A woman arrives, gets into the car and
  drives the bhikkhu to his destination.

    ``I took a Waymo in Phoenix the other night. Works like magic. I’m honestly
    fine waiting four times as long for one because it’s fun, and it’s cheaper.
    Even when they had to send out a manual driver, the experience was smooth
    and fast.''
