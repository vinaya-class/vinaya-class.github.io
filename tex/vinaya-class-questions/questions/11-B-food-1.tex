% A bhikkhu is walking through the market and sees a merchant selling alcohol. Despite feeling tempted, the bhikkhu quickly averts his gaze and continues walking, mindful of the rule against consuming intoxicants (p훮r훮jika offense). In this situation, the bhikkhu does not commit a p훮r훮jika offense related to the passage and the question, and therefore the rule reference code would not be applicable to this particular situation.
