% \subsection*{Sg 10, Schismatic group}

The Buddha made many efforts to end the quarrel at Kosambi which was heading to
a schism but in the end concluded: “These foolish men are as though infatuated;
it is not easy to persuade them,” rising up from his seat, departed. How did the
issue get resolved?

\bigskip

% A: The lay people, upset that the monks of Kosambi drove the Buddha away,
% stopped respecting the monks and offering them alms food, thinking it might
% help to resolve the issue. The monks of Kosambi, as a result, sort out the
% Buddha to resolve this vinaya question.

% \subsection*{Sg 11, Supporting a schismatic group}

Why is this rule of a monk with one, two or three supporters only?

\bigskip

% Four is already a split group

% \subsection*{Sg 12, Not accepting admonishment}

If a bhikkhu difficult to admonished persist with his behaviour, and is then
formally rebuked by the sangha in a sanghakamma of one motion and three
announcements – can he be made to carry out the sanghadisesa penalty?

\bigskip

What additional procedure should the community to carry out?

\bigskip

% A Community planning to impose any of these rules on one of its members should
% be prepared to recite the transaction statement for suspension against him as
% well, in the case that he is so stubborn that he will not see his fault or
% admit his sanghadisesa.

% \subsection*{Sg 13, Not accepting a rebuke or banishment}

What are some examples of wrong modes of livelihood (for bhikkhus) which can lead to corrosion of families?

\bigskip

% \begin{itemize}
% 
% \item running messages and errands - participating in political campaigns.
% 
% \item scheming, talking, hinting, belittling others for the sake of material
%   gain, pursuing gain with gain – giving hoping to receive more
% 
% \item Practicing worldly arts, e.g., medicine, fortune telling, astrology,
%   exorcism, reciting charms, casting spells, performing ceremonies to counteract
%   the influence of the stars, determining propitious sites, setting auspicious
%   dates (for weddings, etc.), interpreting oracles, auguries, or dreams.
% 
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection*{Pc 9, Telling an unordained person about serious offence}

What is meant by serious offence?

\bigskip

There is a non-offense if one tells a lay person the action of an ofference if
one does not mention the class, or the class, if one does not mention the action
– how can this be a problem?

\bigskip

% Lay people generally know about the rules these days.

When might it be helpful to make use of this rule?

\bigskip

% a) A bhikkhu commits a serious offence and refuses to acknowledge it.
%
% b) Assuming to be a bhikkhu after doing a parajika or refusing to do
% rehabilitations after sanghadisesa – the sangha could then authorize a bhikkhu
% to inform the lay community – the bhikkhus supporters – to exert pressure on
% him to submit to the penalty.
%
% c) It could be used to help a weak-willed bhikkhu in mending his ways.

% \subsection*{Pc 12, Evasive reply}

What is meant by evasive or uncooperative? 

\bigskip

% Evasive – one leads the talk aside
% 
% Uncooperative – one remains silent

What are the allowable reasons for remaining silent, asking questions, not speaking to the point?

\bigskip

% Not understanding what is being said, too ill to speak, feeling that to speak
% will create conflict or dissension in the Community, feeling that the Community
% will carry out a transaction unfairly or not in accordance with the rule.

% \subsection*{Pc 13, Criticising community official}

Would there be an offense to criticize and complain about to others, a bhikkhu
who is not a community official?

\bigskip

% dukkata 

To criticize a biased community official to his face to hurt his feelings?

\bigskip

% Pc2 regardless of whether his behaviour has been biased or not.

A bhikkhu complains that the lodgings monk gives the best dwellings to his friends – any offense?

\bigskip

% No offense if the official acts from the four causes of bias – desire, aversion,
% delusion, fear. Why is there no offense?

% A qualifying factor for a community official is that he is unbiased.
