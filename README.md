# Vinaya Class

(This is the `source` branch. It contains the Markdown, LaTeX, etc. files. See
the `master` branch for the HTML output.)

## About

These notes function as support material for discussing the Vinaya, the Buddhist
Monastic Code.

There is more than one way to do this, and variations are welcome. Online notes
are flexible and can accommodate choices on which variation to print for a class.

You don't have to know `git` or `Github` to contribute, see the notes below.

This is a work-in-progress. The aim is to include:

- a schedule with groups or rules
- summary notes (as a hand out for students, and as memory-prompt for the teacher to talk)
- overview of key points (i.e. the mindmaps)
- key details to talk about in depth
- which concept has to be introduced at what rule
- useful situations to analyse
- questions for students to answer
- methods of teaching (ideas for ways to run the classes)

The text can be kept simple enough to not prescribe opinions, and leave the
actual explanation for the teacher to do.

Extended notes are also a possible idea if desired.

### Note texts

The notes are in a text format called 'Markdown', the `.md` files.

They are plain text, you could edit only with Windows Notepad, but it will be
useful to use a Markdown editor.

Try *Typora* for example. It also has PDF export, so if you edit the notes, you
can print sheets without waiting for me to make the online update.

In *Typora*, use `File > Open Folder`, and select the `src` in the extracted
folder.

You should see the list of pages as Markdown files to edit.

### Mindmaps

The mindmap (`.mm`) files are in the `assets` folder. They are created with
*Freeplane*:
